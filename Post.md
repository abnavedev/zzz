Introduction
The attainment of independence for India was no isolated event but had sparked off a new process of decolonisation all over the world. The leaders of young India now faced the tremendous challenge of overcoming the colonial legacy of widespread poverty and disease, near total illiteracy and socio-economic underdevelopment. Centuries of backwardness had to be overcome, promises of freedom were to be kept, a nation was to be built. Thus, in this part, we shall learn about some of the post-independence challenges that Indian leaders faced, as well as methods adopted to tackle them. The Challenges First and foremost, there was the need to strengthen India's unity, particularly in view of India's size and diversity. India's immense regional, religious, linguistic, ethnic and tribal diversities had to be recognised and accepted. The different parts of the country and different sections of people had to be given their due space in the Indian Union. India's faith in secularism had to be strengthened, undaunted by the partition and accompanying violence. India's freedom had to be taken beyond the realm of politics and into the realm of society and economy. For this to be achieved, India had to ensure that the society and economy of the nation do not ever again fall under the domination of a section of people. This called for active role of the state in the society and economy, planning and a large public sector to put India firmly on the path of economic growth with distributive justice. Economic independence also meant self-reliance in food and industry. Thus, the foundation for modern agriculture and industries had to be laid along scientific lines. On the eve of independence, India was far from a free society. Male domination was near total, caste system and untouchability dominated the rural society. Illiteracy was widespread (only 25% men and 7.9% women were literate in 1951). In hindsight, the leaders of free India demonstrated enormous courage and vision when they decided to do two things: one, to build a democratic state among an illiterate people and two, to undertake economic development within a democratic state. Henceforth, India embarked upon the extremely challenging task of resolving all issues within the framework of democracy. The leaders of young India not only repeatedly rejected the 'rice-bowl theory' (that the poor were more interested in a bowl of rice than democracy), they remained committed to strengthening democratic consciousness among the people. Perhaps, this is the reason why India not only managed to retain democracy, in a continent where democracy beyond the trappings of elections hasn't fared very well, but also managed to consolidate its democratic system. And it is due to its democratic system that a vast and diverse country like India has managed to consolidate itself increasingly as a nation state, overtime. The Doubts However, this has not been easy. Many doubts were cast on India's ability to sustain its developmental design. Many critics, both foreign and Indian, predicted that the Indian Union would collapse into linguistic and ethnic fragments; that India's developmental efforts would drown under the weight of its multiple socio-economic problems; and that India would ultimately end up being ruled by a civilian or military authoritarian regime. The left-wing sceptics held that political democracy, economic development, national unity, etc. were all shams aimed at deluding the oppressed classes. They therefore predicted a peasant-based revolution in India on the lines of Russia and China. It was also argued that the Green Revolution would soon turn Red as it benefitted only the big farmers while pushed small and marginal farmers into poverty and migration. In short, by 1960s, doubting India's democracy and development became the norm rather than exception. And as India continued to survive despite failures on many fronts, the observers felt perplexed, failing to realise that the foundation of India was laid not in 1947 but nearly a hundred years before that by the leaders of the freedom struggle, and they had laid the foundation well and deep. The Leaders There is no denying that a great deal depends on the personal qualities of the political leaders. During the early phase of independence, India was fortunate to have leaders whose leadership skills had been immensely honed on account of their participation in the freedom struggle. They had acquired the capacity to deal with diverse interests within a democratic framework and enjoyed a pan-India appeal. Afterwards, however, a scarcity of dedicated leaders has been felt and emergence of politics of class, caste, region and opportunism has severely affected the pace of national development. True, India has not progressed at a pace first envisaged by our national leaders, but it has made considerable gains and justifies our hope and confidence in the future of the nation. After all, had not Gandhiji predicted on the eve of independence that, 'with the end of slavery and the dawn of freedom, all the weaknesses of society are bound to come to the surface. There is, however, no reason to be unnecessarily upset about it. If we keep our balance at such a time, every tangle will be solved'. 
WHAT IS MEANT BY SUBALTERN STUDIES? The term subaltern comes from Latin roots 'sub' meaning below and I 'alternus' meaning all others and is used to describe someone lower in status or rank. The term is also used to describe someone who has no political or economic power, such as a person living under colonial rule. The term was adopted by Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci to refer to those groups in society who are subject to the hegemony of the ruling classes. Subaltern Perspective is also one of the various perspectives from which history is studied. It simply refers to studying history from point of view of the oppressed and the exploited, or simply, the study of history from below. The Subaltern Studies Group (SSG) is a group of South Asian historians who aimed to promote a systematic discussion of subaltern themes in South Asian Studies. The group was initially formed by Ranajit Guha (also known as the father of subaltern studies) in the 1980s and included scholars such as Shahid Amin and Partha Chatterjee. According to Guha, the term in 'Subaltern Studies' refers to the general attribute of subordination in South Asian society whether this is expressed in terms of class, caste, age, gender and office or in any other way'. The SSG arose to redress the imbalance created in academic work by a tendency to focus on elites and elite culture in South Asian historiography and to attempt to formulate a new narrative of the history of India and South Asia as told from the point of view of the colonised rather than that of the colonisers. For instance, with respect to India, Guha asserts that the historiography of Indian nationalism, had long been dominated by elitism and naturally suffered from an elitist bias. Such writing, he asserts cannot acknowledge the contribution made by the people and thus needs to be studied separately. For the subaltern historians, the basic contradiction in Indian society during the colonial period was between the elite (both Indian and foreign) on the one hand and between the subaltern groups, on the other. They believe that the Indian national movement was essentially a farce and represented a struggle for power colonialist elitism and bourgeois-nationalist - among the elites. In Post-colonial Studies, the term 'subaltern' (taken from the work of the SSG) refers to the study of post-colonial societies from a subaltern perspective.

Alter 1857, economic exploitation of India continued and even intensified in many ways. The rising Indian intelligentsia threw up the early national leaders (the Moderates) who were the first to develop an economic critique of the colonial rule. The early Indian nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt and D.E. Wacha began the task of assessing the merits and demerits of British rule in India and developed the thesis that England was exploiting India and draining away its wealth (the economic critique later emerged as the single most significant factor that contributed to the rise of the Indian National Movement in the second half of the 19th century). To counter this nationalist viewpoint, several British administrator-historians gave the thesis of 'paternalism and trusteeship' and insisted on the 'civilising mission' of the British in India. During the First World War and the rising tide of nationalism and anti-colonialism all over the world, some of them began to admit the 'the inherent reasonableness of India's claim to manage her own affairs'. After1947, however, there has been an attempt to strike a balance between the constructive and destructive role of the British in India. For instance, British rule has been held responsible for provoking India into modern politics and enthusing its people with a sense of purpose and unity against the foreign rule. Philips Mason has interestingly depicted the Anglo-Indian association as a forced marriage between the masculine John Bull and the docile Indian girl, ending in a divorce in August 1947. Now, both parties have decided to bury the past and are looking forward to a relationship on equal terms! Clearly, there is a bit of truth in both the arguments. The character of the colonial rule was quite paradoxical, and hence, its impact and legacy were bound to be paradoxical as well, which may be summarised under the following heads- Polity Perhaps the most significant legacy of the British rule was the political and administrative unification of India under one centralised government. Extensive territories from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin and from Chittagong to Khyber Pass were brought under the British, directly or indirectly, creating a larger Indian Empire than even the Mauryas or the Mughals! The political and administrative necessities also compelled the British to put in place uniform administrative and judicial set up for the whole of India. Driven by the need for imperial defence and fuller exploitation of Indian resources, the British began development of modern means of transport and communication. A country-wide network of roads and railways, post and telegraph systems was set up. The British also evolved a common educational system which in time gave rise to an India-wide intelligentsia that shared a common outlook on polity and society and thought in pan-India terms. All these developments gave India an appearance of unity and contributed to the first stirrings of national consciousness. However, the colonial legacy with regard to the political unity of India was marked with a strange paradox. The British soon began to fear the unity of the Indian people and adopted the policy of "divide and rule' or of "counterpoises'. They tried to capitalise on the already existing fault lines of caste, class, region and religion and sowed the seeds of communalism, culminating in India's partition. Indian bureaucrats, specially the ICS officers formed a rigid and exclusive caste; their narrow outlook became a major obstacle.in the radical socio-economic and political change that was sought after independence. The spread of English education in India also came with its own divisive effects. While it resulted in the spread of modern ideas of democracy and nationalism, the emphasis on English and high fees for schools and colleges made education a virtual monopoly of the rich, creating a gulf between the educated and- the masses which has persisted to haunt India even today. Another paradox of the colonial state was that it introduced in India a parliamentary system of government but continued to retain the reigns of state power. Constitutional concessions were regularly offered from time to time in the form of various Council of India Acts and the Government of India Acts, but the real power remained accumulated in the hands of the British Governor General. The franchise remained extremely narrow, the legislatures unrepresentative. Thus, on the eve of Independence, what India inherited was merely 'despotism in a constitutional garb' and establishment of true democracy continues to remain a challenge. For instance, even after 70 years of independence, country's politics remains dominated by the Nehru-Gandhi family in many ways. Law and Administration The paradoxical nature of the colonial state was also visible in its law and administration. While basically authoritarian and autocratic, it introduced certain liberal elements as well like the rule of law and civil liberties. The British deserve the credit for introducing in India the modern concept of rule of law, which meant that administration was to be carried out as per the formulated laws and not according to the whims and fancies of any ruler. Yet, the laws were often repressive and police and the civil servants continued to exercise a great deal of extra-legal powers! Civil liberties like freedom of press, speech and association extended in normal times were drastically curtailed in the periods of freedom struggle. The concept of equality before law also fell short of its promise. Court procedures were often quite expensive, denying the common man affordable justice and created a 'legal divide' in society. Though a relatively independent judiciary was set up, it also ultimately served the interests of the ruling class often at the cost of true justice to the common people. The government of free-India continues to struggle with the various shortcomings of the judicial system. Similarly, the much-praised Indian Civil Service is not without its drawbacks. The ICS was created as a close preserve of the Europeans to rule India with iron- hands. The liberal salaries and allowances and lavish pension paid to these officers was criticised as a big drain on India's resources. Dadabhai Naoroji even denounced the ICS as 'leeches' that sucked India's blood. But even after independence, the IAS has largely remained a 'cult' and as put by Rabindranath Tagore, 'untouched by hand', i.e., insensitive to the feelings of the people and out-of-synch with the new socio-political currents. Even today, Indian bureaucracy continues to be accused of several bureau-pathologies including presence of imperial mindset and lack of service attitude. Education The spread of English education in India came with its own merits and demerits. In 1835, the British inaugurated the system of English education in India with the intention of creating a loyal class of English educated Indians who could carry out clerical tasks. According to Macaulay, the idea was to form "a class of persons, Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect." However, the English system of education opened to the Indians the floodgates of European liberal thought. It familiarised the Indians with the modern European ideas of equality, liberty, nationalism and democracy. Some of them visited England for higher education. There they saw first-hand the life of people in a free country. Thus, realising the hypocrisy of the British in India, this educated Indian middle class itself took on the leadership of the Indian national movement. Moreover, English itself became the lingua franca of the Indian nationalists. In the absence of such a common language, it would have been very difficult for the nationalists to organise a movement of all India character. However, the reality was that neither the Company nor the Crown was really interested in promoting any kind of learning in India. It may be aptly stated that the emergence of both, the Indian Renaissance as well as the Indian National Movement, were as much a result of British education policies as a reaction to it. Changes in education system were made to promote British interests such as supply of clerks, creation of market for British goods and justify the colonial rule. Thus, the colonial education system promoted learning by rote and the rational and critical faculties of the students remained underdeveloped. A meagre sum was allocated for promotion of learning activities. This sum was spent in the establishment of a handful of English schools and colleges at the cost of mass education with the net effect that literacy was hardly better in 1921 than in 1821. Emphasis on English also prevented fuller development of Indian languages and high fees for schools and colleges made education a virtual monopoly of the rich, limiting the spread of education to an elite class. The filtration theory did not work in practice and instead created a linguistic and cultural divide between the educated few and the illiterate masses. Scientific and technical education and women's education was also neglected as it lacked usefulness in the eyes of the British. The neglect of technical education gave rise to the phenomenon of educated unemployed. Many of these drawbacks of the colonial education system still pervade Indian schools and colleges. Society Social and religious institutions were an area in which the British intervened with great caution. The interventions came after much procrastination and adequate pragmatic political consideration. It was also seen that the impact of most of the legislative interventions was limited and did not evoke any violent Indian response. All the same, even this policy of limited social intervention was abandoned by the colonial government in the wake of the Revolt of 1857 and replaced by support to orthodox elements of society. In the field of Indian cultural life, however, the western impact was all-pervading and greatly influenced Indian art, architecture, literature and painting. By the time the British left, western way of life had made deep inroads into Indian society and culture affecting outlook, food habits, fashion, etc. Economy The British had conquered India driven by commercial and economic gains and naturally the British impact in economic sphere was the most disastrous and devastating. The rise of British supremacy Ied to the subordination of Indian economy as per the needs and interests of the British rulers whose main interests lay in exploitation of Indian resources and enrichment of their own people at the cost of Indian people. British economic policies such as new land revenue policies, discriminatory trade restrictions, domination of markets and continuous conquests had an adverse impact on almost all classes of Indian people from peasants and artisans upto the ruling class. The British policies brought about a ruin of Indian agriculture, trade and industry and resulted in a complete breakdown of the traditional economic structure. The self-sufficiency of the villages was destroyed and Indian economy was rapidly transformed into a colonial economy. Once transformed, the colonial economy's main role was to serve the interests of Britain. As such, an arbitrary international division of labour was forced upon India and it was converted into a producer of raw materials to feed the ever hungry British industries. Thus, India's economy was integrated with the world economy, though in a subservient position. Further, the Indian masses wailed under the weight of a highly inequitable tax structure - with peasants paying the highest taxes in the form of land revenue while the upper-income groups such as bureaucrats, landlords and merchants hardly paid any taxes (in 1900-01, land revenue and salt tax formed 53% and 16% of the total revenue of the government, respectively). Additionally, a major part of the revenue or social surplus appropriated by the state was spent, not in improving agriculture or the lot of the taxpayers, but in meeting the needs of the colonial state and in payments of tribute to Britain. Such 'drain of wealth' clearly resulted in steady impoverishment of the Indian masses, sapped India of essential resources and put limits on the extent of future development. Under the British, agriculture came to be dominated by the colonial state, landlords, merchants and money lenders. It became infested with problems of heavy taxation, technical backwardness, extremely low investment in agriculture, low yields per acre, subinfeudation, evictions, fragmentation of land holdings, forced labour, tenancy, usury, etc. that rendered the profession financially unviable. Consequently, by the time the British left India, "one of the granaries of Asia had been converted into a land of perpetual scarcity and famine'. Indian industry met a similar fate - low production technology, lopsided regional development, poor work conditions, stranglehold of British finance capital and ruin of handicraft industry in the face of competition from cheaper, machine-made goods imported from Britain. Driven by the need to preserve India as the 'agricultural farm of industrialised Britain', the British economic policies resulted in a steady de- industrialisation of India. Though certain modern industries did develop in the second half of the 19th century, their development was grossly inadequate both in terms of production and employment. India severely lagged behind in the development of basic industries such as capital goods, machine tools, electric power, coal, iron and steel, locomotives, banking and insurance. Driven by the need for imperial defence from both external and internal threats and fuller exploitation of Indian resources, the British also initiated the development of means of transport and communication, built roads and railways. However, the impact of railway development in India was negative in many ways. Unlike in Britain and the US, railways did not boost steel and machine industries in India (the railway companies imported almost all they needed); the railway freight rates were also so fixed as to favor export-import and discriminate against movement of India-made goods. Though severely limited, the rise of modern industries under the British did provide the material basis for the subsequent emergence of modern industry in India. An important social consequence of this limited industrial development was the emergence of the Indian industrial capitalist class and the working class. Even as these classes formed a miniscule part of the Indian population, they represented new technology, new social relations and new outlook with the consequence that their economic and political contribution in 19th and 20th centuries far outweighed their numbers. Further, by 1947, the Indian capital had also made a great deal of headway in large-scale industrial sector (60% of units), small-scale industrial sector (almost wholly based on Indian capital), bulk of internal trade as well as banking and insurance. However, it must be recalled that the development of Indian industry and capital was severely limited and occurred not because of, but in spite of, colonialism and after a prolonged politico-economic struggle. The net impact of British economic policies in India was widespread poverty, destitution, disease and malnutrition culminating in a series of major and minor famines that run like a thread throughout India's colonial period. Underdevelopment was also reflected by other dimensions such as stagnating per capita income, high level of illiteracy (84% total, 92% among women), high annual death rate (25 per 1,000 persons), high infant mortality rate (175-190 per 1,000 live births), low life expectancy (32 years in 1951) and spread of epidemics like plague, small pox and malaria that wiped out several thousands of people every year. Supply of water and electricity, services of health and sanitation were highly compromised or non- existent. The misery of Indian masses was further accentuated by the prevalence of extreme inequality in income, wealth and opportunity. Clearly, the British rulers left behind a legacy of widespread underdevelopment and poverty, the responsibility of which lies squarely on the shoulders of British imperialist rulers. The prolonged colonial exploitation has weighed heavily on India's development trajectory since independence. Hence, in 1947, India emerged as a free nation but with the tremendous baggage of two hundred years of colonial past. The British rule had brought about wide- ranging changes in Indian economy, polity and society - many of them have aptly been described as 'development of underdevelopment' and left behind a legacy of difficulties. They left behind a colonial economy, colonial polity, colonial society and even colonial outlook and above all, the ever present danger of neo-colonialism lurking all around. It was estimated that 10.3 million people starved to death during the 1876-1879 period, most of which were in South India (the tragedy is also referred to as the Madras famine). British colonial rule argued that famine relief would be an inappropriate response and encourage laziness. Some officials argued that according to the Thomas R. Malthus theory, famines are a nature's way for population con- trol and argued that the British government should not intervene. British government continued its policy of "forced export" of food from India in during this time. The poverty, misery and diseases wiped out villages and families. Some farmers and their families committed suicide suffering this trauma and extended period of starvation. Parents killed themselves so that their children could eat the remaining scraps of food, creating a pool of abandoned and forsaken children.

LEGACY OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT While India inherited colonial economy and administrative structures from the British Raj; it inherited values, ideals and vision from the national movement. These values and ideals were neither a part of India's tradition, nor a legacy of the colonial rule, but consciously cherished by the national leaders and deeply ingrained by the national movement. Faith in the Capacity of the Masses In the field of politics, the Indian National Movement was perhaps the greatest mass movement in world history. Specially after the emergence of Fig. 1.2 "My nationalism, fierce Mahatma Gandhi in 1919, the movement acquired a distinct ideological orientation. Gandhi was of the view that freedom for India could come only with the active, participation of the masses. He based the freedom struggle on the basic premise that the masses are the subjects and not objects of politics. Hence, Gandhi tried to bridge the gap between the leaders and the led. He was responsible for making the Congress Party more democratic and brought it closer to the masses. The bedrock of his politics was his immense faith in the capacity of the masses, their courage and moral strength. It was because of this ideological legacy of the national movement that the leaders of independent India unhesitatingly put faith in the capacity of the masses and introduced popular sovereignty and universal adult franchise in a largely poor and illiterate society. though it is, is not exclusive, is not devised to harm any nation or individual." -Mahatma Gandhi Principles of Non-Violence and Non-Aggression Satyagraha and non-violence were the other chief aspects of Gandhian ideology. Though the principle of returning good for evil is not new and has been practiced by many thinkers and preachers including Buddha and Christ, Gandhi's contribution lies in the fact that he brought satyagraha out from merely personal life to larger public life. He made satyagraha a tool for social, political and economic problems which was a truly original and novel contribution. The principles of non-violence and non-aggression created the much needed temper for democracy and formed the bedrock of all the internal as well as external relations of free India. Civil Libertarian and Democratic Ideals Similarly, the leaders of the national movement were from the very beginning committed to the ideals of democracy and advocated full range of civil liberties for the individuals. Throughout the movement, the nationalists struggled for the freedom of speech and press, freedom to form associations and agitate peacefully. In 1937, when Congress Ministries were formed, civil liberties were promptly extended to the various sections of society including the peasants, workers, students as well as to the radical socialists and communist parties. The national movement not only provided the much needed experience but also the will to put in place a liberal democratic state in free India. A legacy of the national movement, the ideal naturally found a firm place in the Indian Constitution. Right to Dissent and Right to Minority Opinion The chief vehicle of the national movement, i.e., the Indian National Congress itself was an umbrella organisation, representing a cross-section of views and opinions. Hence it did not believe in uniformity of views but instead firmly believed in right to dissent, freedom of expression and decision by consensus; minority views were encouraged to be openly held and freely expressed. Policies and resolutions were richly debated before being voted upon. Along with the INC, most other political organisations of the time functioned along similar lines with the result that, by 1947, culture of tolerance and respect for dissent and for minority opinion had-already deep in roads into Indian mindset. This is also the reason why multi-party democracy and civil liberties have fared differently in India and-Pakistan. Self-Reliant Development with Equality and Justice The nationalist economists also developed a comprehensive economic critique of the colonial rule. G.V. Joshi, D.E. Wacha, G. Subramaniya lyer, G.K. 6okhale, Prithwis Chandra Ray and several other political activists gave their own analysis of the economic impact of colonial rule and subjected the entire range of colonial policies to minute scrutiny. Eventually all their efforts converged at one point and found the British rule at the vortex of India's underdevelopment. They were able to see that India's poverty was not inherent or natural but very much man-made (or rather British-made) and removable and made this economic critique as the main plank of their nationalist economic agitation. The early nationalists showed trade, industry and finance as the three pillars of economic domination. They highlighted that economic exploitation of India was no longer carried out by the crude tools of plunder and tribute but through more sophisticated modern phenomenon of 'free trade'. Of particular concern to them was the decline of Indian traditional handicraft industry. They looked upon foreign capital as disguised evil and were unanimous on the view that India's future economic development should be based on Indian capital and not foreign capital. Further, the early economists highlighted that developmental and welfare departments were starved at the cost of those departments that fulfilled British needs such as defence. On the basis of the above critique, the nationalists developed a broad economic strategy to combat India's economic underdevelopment. They envisaged self- reliant economic development for India based on indigenous capital; protection and encouragement to domestic industries; and restricted entry of foreign goods and foreign capital. In order to achieve these objectives, they emphasised on planned, state-driven rapid socio-economic development along modern, scientific lines. Further, the vision of the national leaders on socio-economic development was quite radical and way ahead of its times. The removal of poverty' emerged as the second most important objective after the overthrow of the British rule. Moreover, the leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose succeeded in giving the national movement a decidedly socialist-tinge and socio-economic equality emerged as yet another significant goal. In fact, the nationalists adopted an increasingly radical programme of socio- economic reform. As early as 1931, at its Karachi Session, the INC adopted a Resolution on Fundamental Rights and National Economic Programme (also known as Karachi Declaration). The declaration on fundamental rights guaranteed basic civil rights of free speech, free press, free assembly and freedom of association, equality before the law irrespective of caste, creed or sex, neutrality of the state in regard to all religions, elections on the basis of universal adult franchise, and free and compulsory primary education. Additionally, the resolution on National Economic Programme promised substantial reduction in rent and revenue, relief from agricultural indebtedness and control of usury, better conditions for workers such as living wage, limited hours of work and protection of women workers, the right to organise and form union to workers and peasants, and state ownership or control of key industries, mines and means of transport. It also laid down that the culture, language and script of the minorities shall be protected. Henceforth, the Karachi Declaration formed the basic document of the nation's socio-economic program for later years. "The land belongs to those who work on it and to no one else." -Gandhi in 1942 Commitment to Egalitarian Society Among the socio-economic goals, of special significance for the nationalists was the upliftment of the most oppressed classes of Indian society that included the poor, the minorities, the women and the lower castes. Gandhi played the most significant role in involving women in the national movement. He believed that- 'a woman is a companion of man, gifted with equal mental capacities and she has an equal right to freedom and liberty as he.' He also believed that women were better suited for Satyagraha protest as they had the right qualities needed for a non-violent struggle. Consequently, what we saw was a massive participation of women in the national movement. The women participated in the Salt March in large numbers, they promoted hand spun khadi and picketed shops selling liquor and foreign goods. They organised Prabhat Pheris and also provided food and shelter to many political activists who had gone underground. The participation of women in the national movement helped in breaking down several old barriers and became the single biggest factor in transforming the role and status of women in Indian society. Led by Gandhi, the national movement also laid special emphasis on removal of caste inequalities and abolition of untouchability. It is a legacy of the national movement that the constitution of India accords Right to Equality as a Fundamental Right to all its citizens and includes equality before law; prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, gender or place of birth; equality of opportunity in matters of employment; abolition of untouchability and abolition of titles. Faith in Secularism From the very beginning the national leaders were committed to the ideal of secularism. Secularism itself was defined in a broad sense to include separation of religion from the state, neutrality of state with regard to all religions, equal respect towards all religions, treatment of religion as a private matter for the individual, absence of discrimination based on religion and opposition to communalism. Commitment to secularism was clearly worded in the 1931 Karachi Declaration on Fundamental Rights. True, Gandhi was a deeply religious person who initially held that religion, the basis of morality, must pervade all realms of a person's life and was, hence, inseparable from politics. But when he saw that the communalists were using religion to ignite passions and divide the countrymen, he himself moved the Karachi resolution and overtly began to preach the separation of religion from politics. In 1942, he declared, "Religion is the personal affair of each individual. It must not be mixed up with politics or national affairs." Jawaharlal Nehru also vehemently opposed communalism and was quick to recognise it as the Indian form of fascism. True, the national leaders failed to devise a long term strategy to combat the communal forces and the country was finally partitioned amidst communal carnage. But despite the trauma and bloodshed, the Indian leaders continued to repose their faith in the ideal of secularism and enshrined it as a basic feature in the Indian constitution. Vision of a United India from its early days, the national movement was committed to the cause of welding India into one nation. As early as 1885, the INC was formed as an all-India body to put up a united front against a common enemy, i.e., the British rule. India had begun to enter the process of becoming a nation, and the first major objective of the founders of Indian National Congress was to weld India into one nation. In its very first meeting, the aims and objectives of the organisation put forth included promotion of friendship among the countrymen; eradication of all possible prejudices relating to race, creed or province and consolidation of sentiments of national unity. While the national leaders acknowledged the role of the British in uniting India politically and administratively, they were simultaneously aware of the divisive policies which they actively countered. To the national leaders, the regional-cultural identities did not appear as an obstacle in the emergence of a national identity, but as an integral part of it. Overtime, this vision gave birth to dual concepts of unity in diversity and national integration which again found firm place in the Indian constitution. Internationalism and Independent Foreign Policy India's foreign policy after Independence was also rooted in the international outlook of the nationalists that had evolved overtime and was essentially based on opposition to colonialism and support to the colonised people all over the world. During World War II, the nationalists had adopted a strong anti-imperialist and anti-fascist stand. It was clearly reflected in the presidential address of Jawaharlal Nehru (Lucknow Session, 1936) when he stated, "We see the world divided up into two vast groups today-the imperialist and fascist on one side, the socialist and nationalist on the other... Inevitably we take our stand with the progressive forces of the world which are ranged against imperialism and fascism". Most remarkably, though India was itself engaged in a life and death struggle against imperialism and racism, its leaders took care never to take recourse to reverse racism and to avoid hatred towards the British at all times. Thus, Indian nationalism never crossed, the line and largely succeeded in maintaining a safe distance from chauvinism or jingoism. High Norms of Politics and Political Behavior The national movement also bequeathed to independent India the high norms of politics and political behaviour. The national leaders including Dadabhai Naoroji, Surendranath Banerjee, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Aurobindo Ghose, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Sardar Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, Acharya Narendra Dev, Jayaprakash Narayan, Mahatma Gandhi and others were ideologues and moralists of the highest order. It was owing to their dedication and sincerity of purpose for India's emancipation that they were able to stir vast masses of Indian people into political action. It held true for the political cadres who readily gave up their jobs and comfort of family life to dedicate themselves full time for the cause of the nation. Yet another legacy of the national movement was the tradition of accommodative politics. The movement was able to unite varied people into one force through a painstaking process of compromise, accommodation and reconciliation of different points of view. This was an invaluable legacy for a young nation that now faced the enormous challenge of keeping itself united even after the common enemy was gone, without giving way to endless bickering and chaos. Capacity to Change with Changing Times The national movement also showed the remarkable capacity to change and renovate as per the need of the changing times. Its programme and policies underwent continuous change as is manifest in the transition from the phase of moderate politics to that of the extremists and finally to that of mass mobilisation under Mahatma Gandhi. The movement took a step forward and sometimes even backtracked as per the changing policy of the colonial rulers. It therefore stood for dynamism and innovation in many ways and led behind yet another invaluable legacy for the young nation. In the end, it may be said that the national movement and its leaders left behind a rich legacy of values, ideals and vision for socio-economic development of the nation. Young India, on its part, has largely remained loyal to the legacy left behind by its founding fathers and many of the values and ideals discussed above have been enshrined in the Constitution of free India. However, it must be remembered that no legacy, however rich, can last forever. Since Independence, many weaknesses have surfaced from time to time and it is upto the new generation to draw upon its lessons well. For isn't it rightly said, 'Learn from history or you are doomed to repeat it!"
