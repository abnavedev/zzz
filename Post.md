Introduction
The attainment of independence for India was no isolated event but had sparked off a new process of decolonisation all over the world. The leaders of young India now faced the tremendous challenge of overcoming the colonial legacy of widespread poverty and disease, near total illiteracy and socio-economic underdevelopment. Centuries of backwardness had to be overcome, promises of freedom were to be kept, a nation was to be built. Thus, in this part, we shall learn about some of the post-independence challenges that Indian leaders faced, as well as methods adopted to tackle them. The Challenges First and foremost, there was the need to strengthen India's unity, particularly in view of India's size and diversity. India's immense regional, religious, linguistic, ethnic and tribal diversities had to be recognised and accepted. The different parts of the country and different sections of people had to be given their due space in the Indian Union. India's faith in secularism had to be strengthened, undaunted by the partition and accompanying violence. India's freedom had to be taken beyond the realm of politics and into the realm of society and economy. For this to be achieved, India had to ensure that the society and economy of the nation do not ever again fall under the domination of a section of people. This called for active role of the state in the society and economy, planning and a large public sector to put India firmly on the path of economic growth with distributive justice. Economic independence also meant self-reliance in food and industry. Thus, the foundation for modern agriculture and industries had to be laid along scientific lines. On the eve of independence, India was far from a free society. Male domination was near total, caste system and untouchability dominated the rural society. Illiteracy was widespread (only 25% men and 7.9% women were literate in 1951). In hindsight, the leaders of free India demonstrated enormous courage and vision when they decided to do two things: one, to build a democratic state among an illiterate people and two, to undertake economic development within a democratic state. Henceforth, India embarked upon the extremely challenging task of resolving all issues within the framework of democracy. The leaders of young India not only repeatedly rejected the 'rice-bowl theory' (that the poor were more interested in a bowl of rice than democracy), they remained committed to strengthening democratic consciousness among the people. Perhaps, this is the reason why India not only managed to retain democracy, in a continent where democracy beyond the trappings of elections hasn't fared very well, but also managed to consolidate its democratic system. And it is due to its democratic system that a vast and diverse country like India has managed to consolidate itself increasingly as a nation state, overtime. The Doubts However, this has not been easy. Many doubts were cast on India's ability to sustain its developmental design. Many critics, both foreign and Indian, predicted that the Indian Union would collapse into linguistic and ethnic fragments; that India's developmental efforts would drown under the weight of its multiple socio-economic problems; and that India would ultimately end up being ruled by a civilian or military authoritarian regime. The left-wing sceptics held that political democracy, economic development, national unity, etc. were all shams aimed at deluding the oppressed classes. They therefore predicted a peasant-based revolution in India on the lines of Russia and China. It was also argued that the Green Revolution would soon turn Red as it benefitted only the big farmers while pushed small and marginal farmers into poverty and migration. In short, by 1960s, doubting India's democracy and development became the norm rather than exception. And as India continued to survive despite failures on many fronts, the observers felt perplexed, failing to realise that the foundation of India was laid not in 1947 but nearly a hundred years before that by the leaders of the freedom struggle, and they had laid the foundation well and deep. The Leaders There is no denying that a great deal depends on the personal qualities of the political leaders. During the early phase of independence, India was fortunate to have leaders whose leadership skills had been immensely honed on account of their participation in the freedom struggle. They had acquired the capacity to deal with diverse interests within a democratic framework and enjoyed a pan-India appeal. Afterwards, however, a scarcity of dedicated leaders has been felt and emergence of politics of class, caste, region and opportunism has severely affected the pace of national development. True, India has not progressed at a pace first envisaged by our national leaders, but it has made considerable gains and justifies our hope and confidence in the future of the nation. After all, had not Gandhiji predicted on the eve of independence that, 'with the end of slavery and the dawn of freedom, all the weaknesses of society are bound to come to the surface. There is, however, no reason to be unnecessarily upset about it. If we keep our balance at such a time, every tangle will be solved'. 
WHAT IS MEANT BY SUBALTERN STUDIES? The term subaltern comes from Latin roots 'sub' meaning below and I 'alternus' meaning all others and is used to describe someone lower in status or rank. The term is also used to describe someone who has no political or economic power, such as a person living under colonial rule. The term was adopted by Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci to refer to those groups in society who are subject to the hegemony of the ruling classes. Subaltern Perspective is also one of the various perspectives from which history is studied. It simply refers to studying history from point of view of the oppressed and the exploited, or simply, the study of history from below. The Subaltern Studies Group (SSG) is a group of South Asian historians who aimed to promote a systematic discussion of subaltern themes in South Asian Studies. The group was initially formed by Ranajit Guha (also known as the father of subaltern studies) in the 1980s and included scholars such as Shahid Amin and Partha Chatterjee. According to Guha, the term in 'Subaltern Studies' refers to the general attribute of subordination in South Asian society whether this is expressed in terms of class, caste, age, gender and office or in any other way'. The SSG arose to redress the imbalance created in academic work by a tendency to focus on elites and elite culture in South Asian historiography and to attempt to formulate a new narrative of the history of India and South Asia as told from the point of view of the colonised rather than that of the colonisers. For instance, with respect to India, Guha asserts that the historiography of Indian nationalism, had long been dominated by elitism and naturally suffered from an elitist bias. Such writing, he asserts cannot acknowledge the contribution made by the people and thus needs to be studied separately. For the subaltern historians, the basic contradiction in Indian society during the colonial period was between the elite (both Indian and foreign) on the one hand and between the subaltern groups, on the other. They believe that the Indian national movement was essentially a farce and represented a struggle for power colonialist elitism and bourgeois-nationalist - among the elites. In Post-colonial Studies, the term 'subaltern' (taken from the work of the SSG) refers to the study of post-colonial societies from a subaltern perspective.

Alter 1857, economic exploitation of India continued and even intensified in many ways. The rising Indian intelligentsia threw up the early national leaders (the Moderates) who were the first to develop an economic critique of the colonial rule. The early Indian nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt and D.E. Wacha began the task of assessing the merits and demerits of British rule in India and developed the thesis that England was exploiting India and draining away its wealth (the economic critique later emerged as the single most significant factor that contributed to the rise of the Indian National Movement in the second half of the 19th century). To counter this nationalist viewpoint, several British administrator-historians gave the thesis of 'paternalism and trusteeship' and insisted on the 'civilising mission' of the British in India. During the First World War and the rising tide of nationalism and anti-colonialism all over the world, some of them began to admit the 'the inherent reasonableness of India's claim to manage her own affairs'. After1947, however, there has been an attempt to strike a balance between the constructive and destructive role of the British in India. For instance, British rule has been held responsible for provoking India into modern politics and enthusing its people with a sense of purpose and unity against the foreign rule. Philips Mason has interestingly depicted the Anglo-Indian association as a forced marriage between the masculine John Bull and the docile Indian girl, ending in a divorce in August 1947. Now, both parties have decided to bury the past and are looking forward to a relationship on equal terms! Clearly, there is a bit of truth in both the arguments. The character of the colonial rule was quite paradoxical, and hence, its impact and legacy were bound to be paradoxical as well, which may be summarised under the following heads- Polity Perhaps the most significant legacy of the British rule was the political and administrative unification of India under one centralised government. Extensive territories from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin and from Chittagong to Khyber Pass were brought under the British, directly or indirectly, creating a larger Indian Empire than even the Mauryas or the Mughals! The political and administrative necessities also compelled the British to put in place uniform administrative and judicial set up for the whole of India. Driven by the need for imperial defence and fuller exploitation of Indian resources, the British began development of modern means of transport and communication. A country-wide network of roads and railways, post and telegraph systems was set up. The British also evolved a common educational system which in time gave rise to an India-wide intelligentsia that shared a common outlook on polity and society and thought in pan-India terms. All these developments gave India an appearance of unity and contributed to the first stirrings of national consciousness. However, the colonial legacy with regard to the political unity of India was marked with a strange paradox. The British soon began to fear the unity of the Indian people and adopted the policy of "divide and rule' or of "counterpoises'. They tried to capitalise on the already existing fault lines of caste, class, region and religion and sowed the seeds of communalism, culminating in India's partition. Indian bureaucrats, specially the ICS officers formed a rigid and exclusive caste; their narrow outlook became a major obstacle.in the radical socio-economic and political change that was sought after independence. The spread of English education in India also came with its own divisive effects. While it resulted in the spread of modern ideas of democracy and nationalism, the emphasis on English and high fees for schools and colleges made education a virtual monopoly of the rich, creating a gulf between the educated and- the masses which has persisted to haunt India even today. Another paradox of the colonial state was that it introduced in India a parliamentary system of government but continued to retain the reigns of state power. Constitutional concessions were regularly offered from time to time in the form of various Council of India Acts and the Government of India Acts, but the real power remained accumulated in the hands of the British Governor General. The franchise remained extremely narrow, the legislatures unrepresentative. Thus, on the eve of Independence, what India inherited was merely 'despotism in a constitutional garb' and establishment of true democracy continues to remain a challenge. For instance, even after 70 years of independence, country's politics remains dominated by the Nehru-Gandhi family in many ways. Law and Administration The paradoxical nature of the colonial state was also visible in its law and administration. While basically authoritarian and autocratic, it introduced certain liberal elements as well like the rule of law and civil liberties. The British deserve the credit for introducing in India the modern concept of rule of law, which meant that administration was to be carried out as per the formulated laws and not according to the whims and fancies of any ruler. Yet, the laws were often repressive and police and the civil servants continued to exercise a great deal of extra-legal powers! Civil liberties like freedom of press, speech and association extended in normal times were drastically curtailed in the periods of freedom struggle. The concept of equality before law also fell short of its promise. Court procedures were often quite expensive, denying the common man affordable justice and created a 'legal divide' in society. Though a relatively independent judiciary was set up, it also ultimately served the interests of the ruling class often at the cost of true justice to the common people. The government of free-India continues to struggle with the various shortcomings of the judicial system. Similarly, the much-praised Indian Civil Service is not without its drawbacks. The ICS was created as a close preserve of the Europeans to rule India with iron- hands. The liberal salaries and allowances and lavish pension paid to these officers was criticised as a big drain on India's resources. Dadabhai Naoroji even denounced the ICS as 'leeches' that sucked India's blood. But even after independence, the IAS has largely remained a 'cult' and as put by Rabindranath Tagore, 'untouched by hand', i.e., insensitive to the feelings of the people and out-of-synch with the new socio-political currents. Even today, Indian bureaucracy continues to be accused of several bureau-pathologies including presence of imperial mindset and lack of service attitude. Education The spread of English education in India came with its own merits and demerits. In 1835, the British inaugurated the system of English education in India with the intention of creating a loyal class of English educated Indians who could carry out clerical tasks. According to Macaulay, the idea was to form "a class of persons, Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect." However, the English system of education opened to the Indians the floodgates of European liberal thought. It familiarised the Indians with the modern European ideas of equality, liberty, nationalism and democracy. Some of them visited England for higher education. There they saw first-hand the life of people in a free country. Thus, realising the hypocrisy of the British in India, this educated Indian middle class itself took on the leadership of the Indian national movement. Moreover, English itself became the lingua franca of the Indian nationalists. In the absence of such a common language, it would have been very difficult for the nationalists to organise a movement of all India character. However, the reality was that neither the Company nor the Crown was really interested in promoting any kind of learning in India. It may be aptly stated that the emergence of both, the Indian Renaissance as well as the Indian National Movement, were as much a result of British education policies as a reaction to it. Changes in education system were made to promote British interests such as supply of clerks, creation of market for British goods and justify the colonial rule. Thus, the colonial education system promoted learning by rote and the rational and critical faculties of the students remained underdeveloped. A meagre sum was allocated for promotion of learning activities. This sum was spent in the establishment of a handful of English schools and colleges at the cost of mass education with the net effect that literacy was hardly better in 1921 than in 1821. Emphasis on English also prevented fuller development of Indian languages and high fees for schools and colleges made education a virtual monopoly of the rich, limiting the spread of education to an elite class. The filtration theory did not work in practice and instead created a linguistic and cultural divide between the educated few and the illiterate masses. Scientific and technical education and women's education was also neglected as it lacked usefulness in the eyes of the British. The neglect of technical education gave rise to the phenomenon of educated unemployed. Many of these drawbacks of the colonial education system still pervade Indian schools and colleges. Society Social and religious institutions were an area in which the British intervened with great caution. The interventions came after much procrastination and adequate pragmatic political consideration. It was also seen that the impact of most of the legislative interventions was limited and did not evoke any violent Indian response. All the same, even this policy of limited social intervention was abandoned by the colonial government in the wake of the Revolt of 1857 and replaced by support to orthodox elements of society. In the field of Indian cultural life, however, the western impact was all-pervading and greatly influenced Indian art, architecture, literature and painting. By the time the British left, western way of life had made deep inroads into Indian society and culture affecting outlook, food habits, fashion, etc. Economy The British had conquered India driven by commercial and economic gains and naturally the British impact in economic sphere was the most disastrous and devastating. The rise of British supremacy Ied to the subordination of Indian economy as per the needs and interests of the British rulers whose main interests lay in exploitation of Indian resources and enrichment of their own people at the cost of Indian people. British economic policies such as new land revenue policies, discriminatory trade restrictions, domination of markets and continuous conquests had an adverse impact on almost all classes of Indian people from peasants and artisans upto the ruling class. The British policies brought about a ruin of Indian agriculture, trade and industry and resulted in a complete breakdown of the traditional economic structure. The self-sufficiency of the villages was destroyed and Indian economy was rapidly transformed into a colonial economy. Once transformed, the colonial economy's main role was to serve the interests of Britain. As such, an arbitrary international division of labour was forced upon India and it was converted into a producer of raw materials to feed the ever hungry British industries. Thus, India's economy was integrated with the world economy, though in a subservient position. Further, the Indian masses wailed under the weight of a highly inequitable tax structure - with peasants paying the highest taxes in the form of land revenue while the upper-income groups such as bureaucrats, landlords and merchants hardly paid any taxes (in 1900-01, land revenue and salt tax formed 53% and 16% of the total revenue of the government, respectively). Additionally, a major part of the revenue or social surplus appropriated by the state was spent, not in improving agriculture or the lot of the taxpayers, but in meeting the needs of the colonial state and in payments of tribute to Britain. Such 'drain of wealth' clearly resulted in steady impoverishment of the Indian masses, sapped India of essential resources and put limits on the extent of future development. Under the British, agriculture came to be dominated by the colonial state, landlords, merchants and money lenders. It became infested with problems of heavy taxation, technical backwardness, extremely low investment in agriculture, low yields per acre, subinfeudation, evictions, fragmentation of land holdings, forced labour, tenancy, usury, etc. that rendered the profession financially unviable. Consequently, by the time the British left India, "one of the granaries of Asia had been converted into a land of perpetual scarcity and famine'. Indian industry met a similar fate - low production technology, lopsided regional development, poor work conditions, stranglehold of British finance capital and ruin of handicraft industry in the face of competition from cheaper, machine-made goods imported from Britain. Driven by the need to preserve India as the 'agricultural farm of industrialised Britain', the British economic policies resulted in a steady de- industrialisation of India. Though certain modern industries did develop in the second half of the 19th century, their development was grossly inadequate both in terms of production and employment. India severely lagged behind in the development of basic industries such as capital goods, machine tools, electric power, coal, iron and steel, locomotives, banking and insurance. Driven by the need for imperial defence from both external and internal threats and fuller exploitation of Indian resources, the British also initiated the development of means of transport and communication, built roads and railways. However, the impact of railway development in India was negative in many ways. Unlike in Britain and the US, railways did not boost steel and machine industries in India (the railway companies imported almost all they needed); the railway freight rates were also so fixed as to favor export-import and discriminate against movement of India-made goods. Though severely limited, the rise of modern industries under the British did provide the material basis for the subsequent emergence of modern industry in India. An important social consequence of this limited industrial development was the emergence of the Indian industrial capitalist class and the working class. Even as these classes formed a miniscule part of the Indian population, they represented new technology, new social relations and new outlook with the consequence that their economic and political contribution in 19th and 20th centuries far outweighed their numbers. Further, by 1947, the Indian capital had also made a great deal of headway in large-scale industrial sector (60% of units), small-scale industrial sector (almost wholly based on Indian capital), bulk of internal trade as well as banking and insurance. However, it must be recalled that the development of Indian industry and capital was severely limited and occurred not because of, but in spite of, colonialism and after a prolonged politico-economic struggle. The net impact of British economic policies in India was widespread poverty, destitution, disease and malnutrition culminating in a series of major and minor famines that run like a thread throughout India's colonial period. Underdevelopment was also reflected by other dimensions such as stagnating per capita income, high level of illiteracy (84% total, 92% among women), high annual death rate (25 per 1,000 persons), high infant mortality rate (175-190 per 1,000 live births), low life expectancy (32 years in 1951) and spread of epidemics like plague, small pox and malaria that wiped out several thousands of people every year. Supply of water and electricity, services of health and sanitation were highly compromised or non- existent. The misery of Indian masses was further accentuated by the prevalence of extreme inequality in income, wealth and opportunity. Clearly, the British rulers left behind a legacy of widespread underdevelopment and poverty, the responsibility of which lies squarely on the shoulders of British imperialist rulers. The prolonged colonial exploitation has weighed heavily on India's development trajectory since independence. Hence, in 1947, India emerged as a free nation but with the tremendous baggage of two hundred years of colonial past. The British rule had brought about wide- ranging changes in Indian economy, polity and society - many of them have aptly been described as 'development of underdevelopment' and left behind a legacy of difficulties. They left behind a colonial economy, colonial polity, colonial society and even colonial outlook and above all, the ever present danger of neo-colonialism lurking all around. It was estimated that 10.3 million people starved to death during the 1876-1879 period, most of which were in South India (the tragedy is also referred to as the Madras famine). British colonial rule argued that famine relief would be an inappropriate response and encourage laziness. Some officials argued that according to the Thomas R. Malthus theory, famines are a nature's way for population con- trol and argued that the British government should not intervene. British government continued its policy of "forced export" of food from India in during this time. The poverty, misery and diseases wiped out villages and families. Some farmers and their families committed suicide suffering this trauma and extended period of starvation. Parents killed themselves so that their children could eat the remaining scraps of food, creating a pool of abandoned and forsaken children.

LEGACY OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT While India inherited colonial economy and administrative structures from the British Raj; it inherited values, ideals and vision from the national movement. These values and ideals were neither a part of India's tradition, nor a legacy of the colonial rule, but consciously cherished by the national leaders and deeply ingrained by the national movement. Faith in the Capacity of the Masses In the field of politics, the Indian National Movement was perhaps the greatest mass movement in world history. Specially after the emergence of Fig. 1.2 "My nationalism, fierce Mahatma Gandhi in 1919, the movement acquired a distinct ideological orientation. Gandhi was of the view that freedom for India could come only with the active, participation of the masses. He based the freedom struggle on the basic premise that the masses are the subjects and not objects of politics. Hence, Gandhi tried to bridge the gap between the leaders and the led. He was responsible for making the Congress Party more democratic and brought it closer to the masses. The bedrock of his politics was his immense faith in the capacity of the masses, their courage and moral strength. It was because of this ideological legacy of the national movement that the leaders of independent India unhesitatingly put faith in the capacity of the masses and introduced popular sovereignty and universal adult franchise in a largely poor and illiterate society. though it is, is not exclusive, is not devised to harm any nation or individual." -Mahatma Gandhi Principles of Non-Violence and Non-Aggression Satyagraha and non-violence were the other chief aspects of Gandhian ideology. Though the principle of returning good for evil is not new and has been practiced by many thinkers and preachers including Buddha and Christ, Gandhi's contribution lies in the fact that he brought satyagraha out from merely personal life to larger public life. He made satyagraha a tool for social, political and economic problems which was a truly original and novel contribution. The principles of non-violence and non-aggression created the much needed temper for democracy and formed the bedrock of all the internal as well as external relations of free India. Civil Libertarian and Democratic Ideals Similarly, the leaders of the national movement were from the very beginning committed to the ideals of democracy and advocated full range of civil liberties for the individuals. Throughout the movement, the nationalists struggled for the freedom of speech and press, freedom to form associations and agitate peacefully. In 1937, when Congress Ministries were formed, civil liberties were promptly extended to the various sections of society including the peasants, workers, students as well as to the radical socialists and communist parties. The national movement not only provided the much needed experience but also the will to put in place a liberal democratic state in free India. A legacy of the national movement, the ideal naturally found a firm place in the Indian Constitution. Right to Dissent and Right to Minority Opinion The chief vehicle of the national movement, i.e., the Indian National Congress itself was an umbrella organisation, representing a cross-section of views and opinions. Hence it did not believe in uniformity of views but instead firmly believed in right to dissent, freedom of expression and decision by consensus; minority views were encouraged to be openly held and freely expressed. Policies and resolutions were richly debated before being voted upon. Along with the INC, most other political organisations of the time functioned along similar lines with the result that, by 1947, culture of tolerance and respect for dissent and for minority opinion had-already deep in roads into Indian mindset. This is also the reason why multi-party democracy and civil liberties have fared differently in India and-Pakistan. Self-Reliant Development with Equality and Justice The nationalist economists also developed a comprehensive economic critique of the colonial rule. G.V. Joshi, D.E. Wacha, G. Subramaniya lyer, G.K. 6okhale, Prithwis Chandra Ray and several other political activists gave their own analysis of the economic impact of colonial rule and subjected the entire range of colonial policies to minute scrutiny. Eventually all their efforts converged at one point and found the British rule at the vortex of India's underdevelopment. They were able to see that India's poverty was not inherent or natural but very much man-made (or rather British-made) and removable and made this economic critique as the main plank of their nationalist economic agitation. The early nationalists showed trade, industry and finance as the three pillars of economic domination. They highlighted that economic exploitation of India was no longer carried out by the crude tools of plunder and tribute but through more sophisticated modern phenomenon of 'free trade'. Of particular concern to them was the decline of Indian traditional handicraft industry. They looked upon foreign capital as disguised evil and were unanimous on the view that India's future economic development should be based on Indian capital and not foreign capital. Further, the early economists highlighted that developmental and welfare departments were starved at the cost of those departments that fulfilled British needs such as defence. On the basis of the above critique, the nationalists developed a broad economic strategy to combat India's economic underdevelopment. They envisaged self- reliant economic development for India based on indigenous capital; protection and encouragement to domestic industries; and restricted entry of foreign goods and foreign capital. In order to achieve these objectives, they emphasised on planned, state-driven rapid socio-economic development along modern, scientific lines. Further, the vision of the national leaders on socio-economic development was quite radical and way ahead of its times. The removal of poverty' emerged as the second most important objective after the overthrow of the British rule. Moreover, the leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose succeeded in giving the national movement a decidedly socialist-tinge and socio-economic equality emerged as yet another significant goal. In fact, the nationalists adopted an increasingly radical programme of socio- economic reform. As early as 1931, at its Karachi Session, the INC adopted a Resolution on Fundamental Rights and National Economic Programme (also known as Karachi Declaration). The declaration on fundamental rights guaranteed basic civil rights of free speech, free press, free assembly and freedom of association, equality before the law irrespective of caste, creed or sex, neutrality of the state in regard to all religions, elections on the basis of universal adult franchise, and free and compulsory primary education. Additionally, the resolution on National Economic Programme promised substantial reduction in rent and revenue, relief from agricultural indebtedness and control of usury, better conditions for workers such as living wage, limited hours of work and protection of women workers, the right to organise and form union to workers and peasants, and state ownership or control of key industries, mines and means of transport. It also laid down that the culture, language and script of the minorities shall be protected. Henceforth, the Karachi Declaration formed the basic document of the nation's socio-economic program for later years. "The land belongs to those who work on it and to no one else." -Gandhi in 1942 Commitment to Egalitarian Society Among the socio-economic goals, of special significance for the nationalists was the upliftment of the most oppressed classes of Indian society that included the poor, the minorities, the women and the lower castes. Gandhi played the most significant role in involving women in the national movement. He believed that- 'a woman is a companion of man, gifted with equal mental capacities and she has an equal right to freedom and liberty as he.' He also believed that women were better suited for Satyagraha protest as they had the right qualities needed for a non-violent struggle. Consequently, what we saw was a massive participation of women in the national movement. The women participated in the Salt March in large numbers, they promoted hand spun khadi and picketed shops selling liquor and foreign goods. They organised Prabhat Pheris and also provided food and shelter to many political activists who had gone underground. The participation of women in the national movement helped in breaking down several old barriers and became the single biggest factor in transforming the role and status of women in Indian society. Led by Gandhi, the national movement also laid special emphasis on removal of caste inequalities and abolition of untouchability. It is a legacy of the national movement that the constitution of India accords Right to Equality as a Fundamental Right to all its citizens and includes equality before law; prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, gender or place of birth; equality of opportunity in matters of employment; abolition of untouchability and abolition of titles. Faith in Secularism From the very beginning the national leaders were committed to the ideal of secularism. Secularism itself was defined in a broad sense to include separation of religion from the state, neutrality of state with regard to all religions, equal respect towards all religions, treatment of religion as a private matter for the individual, absence of discrimination based on religion and opposition to communalism. Commitment to secularism was clearly worded in the 1931 Karachi Declaration on Fundamental Rights. True, Gandhi was a deeply religious person who initially held that religion, the basis of morality, must pervade all realms of a person's life and was, hence, inseparable from politics. But when he saw that the communalists were using religion to ignite passions and divide the countrymen, he himself moved the Karachi resolution and overtly began to preach the separation of religion from politics. In 1942, he declared, "Religion is the personal affair of each individual. It must not be mixed up with politics or national affairs." Jawaharlal Nehru also vehemently opposed communalism and was quick to recognise it as the Indian form of fascism. True, the national leaders failed to devise a long term strategy to combat the communal forces and the country was finally partitioned amidst communal carnage. But despite the trauma and bloodshed, the Indian leaders continued to repose their faith in the ideal of secularism and enshrined it as a basic feature in the Indian constitution. Vision of a United India from its early days, the national movement was committed to the cause of welding India into one nation. As early as 1885, the INC was formed as an all-India body to put up a united front against a common enemy, i.e., the British rule. India had begun to enter the process of becoming a nation, and the first major objective of the founders of Indian National Congress was to weld India into one nation. In its very first meeting, the aims and objectives of the organisation put forth included promotion of friendship among the countrymen; eradication of all possible prejudices relating to race, creed or province and consolidation of sentiments of national unity. While the national leaders acknowledged the role of the British in uniting India politically and administratively, they were simultaneously aware of the divisive policies which they actively countered. To the national leaders, the regional-cultural identities did not appear as an obstacle in the emergence of a national identity, but as an integral part of it. Overtime, this vision gave birth to dual concepts of unity in diversity and national integration which again found firm place in the Indian constitution. Internationalism and Independent Foreign Policy India's foreign policy after Independence was also rooted in the international outlook of the nationalists that had evolved overtime and was essentially based on opposition to colonialism and support to the colonised people all over the world. During World War II, the nationalists had adopted a strong anti-imperialist and anti-fascist stand. It was clearly reflected in the presidential address of Jawaharlal Nehru (Lucknow Session, 1936) when he stated, "We see the world divided up into two vast groups today-the imperialist and fascist on one side, the socialist and nationalist on the other... Inevitably we take our stand with the progressive forces of the world which are ranged against imperialism and fascism". Most remarkably, though India was itself engaged in a life and death struggle against imperialism and racism, its leaders took care never to take recourse to reverse racism and to avoid hatred towards the British at all times. Thus, Indian nationalism never crossed, the line and largely succeeded in maintaining a safe distance from chauvinism or jingoism. High Norms of Politics and Political Behavior The national movement also bequeathed to independent India the high norms of politics and political behaviour. The national leaders including Dadabhai Naoroji, Surendranath Banerjee, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Aurobindo Ghose, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Sardar Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, Acharya Narendra Dev, Jayaprakash Narayan, Mahatma Gandhi and others were ideologues and moralists of the highest order. It was owing to their dedication and sincerity of purpose for India's emancipation that they were able to stir vast masses of Indian people into political action. It held true for the political cadres who readily gave up their jobs and comfort of family life to dedicate themselves full time for the cause of the nation. Yet another legacy of the national movement was the tradition of accommodative politics. The movement was able to unite varied people into one force through a painstaking process of compromise, accommodation and reconciliation of different points of view. This was an invaluable legacy for a young nation that now faced the enormous challenge of keeping itself united even after the common enemy was gone, without giving way to endless bickering and chaos. Capacity to Change with Changing Times The national movement also showed the remarkable capacity to change and renovate as per the need of the changing times. Its programme and policies underwent continuous change as is manifest in the transition from the phase of moderate politics to that of the extremists and finally to that of mass mobilisation under Mahatma Gandhi. The movement took a step forward and sometimes even backtracked as per the changing policy of the colonial rulers. It therefore stood for dynamism and innovation in many ways and led behind yet another invaluable legacy for the young nation. In the end, it may be said that the national movement and its leaders left behind a rich legacy of values, ideals and vision for socio-economic development of the nation. Young India, on its part, has largely remained loyal to the legacy left behind by its founding fathers and many of the values and ideals discussed above have been enshrined in the Constitution of free India. However, it must be remembered that no legacy, however rich, can last forever. Since Independence, many weaknesses have surfaced from time to time and it is upto the new generation to draw upon its lessons well. For isn't it rightly said, 'Learn from history or you are doomed to repeat it!" 


   On 15th August 1947, though the struggle for independence was over, it marked the beginning of a new struggle, a struggle to survive as an independent nation, realise the promises of freedom and establish a modern democracy. The need of the hour, thus, was to lay down the basic framework of governance upon which the superstructure of a new nation was to be built. Hence, one of the foremost tasks taken up by independent India was the making of the new constitution. MAKING OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION Modern democracies are based on the theory of constitutional government meaning a government which derives its authority from the people and the supreme law of the land. The Constitution simply means a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organisation is acknowledged to be governed. It defines the powers of the main organs of the state, demarcates their responsibilities and regulates their relationships with each other and with the people. It also describes the form of government and reflects people's faith and aspirations. Precursor to Indian Constitution (Government of India Act of 1935) The Government of India Act 1935 was the precursor to Indian Constitution. The Indian Independence Act, 1947 held that until a new Constitution came into force, the 1935 Act would be the constitutional law of India. Certain features of the 1935 Act, with modifications though, were later incorporated in the Constitution of India. These include a federal structure in the form of a Union government and State governments and the division of powers between them (Union List, State List and Concurrent List), Bicameral legislature (the Lower House and the Upper House i.e., Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at the Union level; and State Legislative Assembly and State Legislative Council, at the State level) and the Federal Court (the Supreme Court). ASSEM EONSTITUENT Constituent Assembly The Constituent Assembly is a body of people that frames the fundamental laws of a country. The Constitution of India was framed by a constituent assembly set up under the Cabinet Mission Plan Fig. 2.1 Seal of the Constituent of 1946. INDIA Assembly of India FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY: TIMELINE 1934: The idea for a Constituent Assembly of India was first put forward by M.N. Roy, a pioneer of the communist movement in India. 1935: It became an official demand of the Indian National Congress. 1939: C. Rajagopalachari voiced the demand for a Constituent Assembly based on adult franchise. 8th August 1940: The demand was accepted by the British in the August Offer of Viceroy Linlithgow. 1946: Elections to the Constituent Assembly were held for the first time. Role of Cabinet Mission Plan The idea of a Constituent Assembly was alien to British imperial practice and was accepted by the British on the demand of the Indian National Congress. The Cabinet Mission Plan (that was sent to India in March 1946 to frame a scheme for making a constitution for India) had recommended for a Constituent Assembly comprising of representatives of all major parties. The Cabinet Mission thought that, though the ideal way to form it would be through election on the basis of adult suffrage, there was no time left for that. Earlier that year in January, General Elections 1945-46 were held and provincial legislatures had been elected on the basis of a limited franchise and communal electorates. The Cabinet Mission proposed that the Constituent Assembly be elected by those provincial assemblies. Hence, the Constituent Assembly of India was constituted under the Cabinet Mission Plan on 6"h December 1946 to draft a constitution for India. Composition of the Constituent Assembly The members of the assembly were elected indirectly by members of the newly elected provincial assemblies. The Assembly was not elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage, and Muslims and Sikhs received special representation as minorities. The total membership of the Constituent Assembly founded for undivided India was 385, reduced to 298 (including nine women) after the partition. The members represented various political parties such as the Congress Party, Communist Party of India, Praja Party, Krishak Praja Party, Scheduled Castes Federation, Unionist Muslims and the Muslim League. In addition to these, independent members and representatives from the Governor's Provinces and the Princely States were also represented. Congress Dominance In the Assembly, the Congress enjoyed an overwhelming majority. But the party itself included a wide diversity of opinions-from radical Marxists to Hindu revivalists-all of whom participated in the process. The party also adopted a non-sectarian approach and freely recruited the best available talent, nominating several members from outside the party's fold. For instance, the Congress nominated two Hindu Mahasabha leaders, two Socialists and two Forward Block members in the Constituent Assembly. Boycott by Muslim League The Muslim League had rejected the Cabinet Mission Plan as the Plan had rejected the demand for a full-fledged Pakistan. Thus, the League boycotted the Constituent Assembly and joined it only after the decision to partition British India was taken. When this happened on 14 July 1947, only 23 Muslim Leaguers arrived at the Constituent Assembly of India. The others went to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. Leaders of the Constituent Assembly The leaders of the Assembly comprised of both political and technical leaders. Given the predominance of the Congress party in the Assembly, the political leadership naturally vested in its leaders. The top leadership comprised of Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Dr. Rajendra Prasad or Nehru-Patel-Azad-Prasad, termed as 'the oligarchy' by Granville Austin. Nehru set a formidable example by showing a keen interest in every aspect of constitution making. Patel's interest was only next to Nehru's. Azad enriched many issues of importance with his scholarly and philosophical mind. Prasad earned accolades for maintaining impartiality and dignity of his office (office of the President of the Assembly). Outside the party, the leadership comprised of legal luminaries including the likes of B.R. Ambedkar, K.M. Panikkar, and Pandit Hriday Nath Kunjru (who was not a member of the Constituent Assembly). Granville Austin, chronicler of the history of constitution-making in India had stated, "The Constitution Assembly was a one-party body in an essentially one- party country...one might assume, aware of the character of monolithic political systems in other countries, that a mass party in India would be rigid and narrow in outlook and that its powerful leadership would silence dissent and confine policy and decision-making to the hands of the select few. In India, the reverse was the case. The membership of the Congress in the constituent Assembly and outside held social, economic and political views ranging from the reactionary to the revolutionary, and it did not hesitate to voice them." Status of the Constituent Assembly The Constituent Assembly was constituted under the Cabinet Mission Plan, not as a sovereign body. Viceroy Lord Wavell had intended to appoint the provisional president and issue invitations to the members to attend the first session in his own name. However, Nehru was intent on maintaining the autonomy of the Constituent Assembly of India, which was a brain-child of the national movement and not the British. Nehru, therefore, ensured that the senior-most member in terms of age became the Provisional president and invitations went out in the name of the Secretary of the Assembly. It may further be stated that the Assembly was expected to draft a constitution for India to be enacted by the British government. The Indian Independence Act 1947 had authorised the Governor-General of India to give assent to the Constitution. However, with the independence of India on 15h August 1947, the Constituent Assembly emerged as a sovereign body and also doubled up as the legislature of the new state. The Assembly later got the Constitution authenticated by its own chairman, as a final assertion of the sovereign authority of the Constituent Assembly. Fig. 2.2 Jawaharlal Nehru and other members taking pledge during the midnight session of the Constituent Assembly of India held on 14th and 15th August 1947. Work of the Constituent Assembly Drafting the Indian Constitution was no easy task. The Constitution had to live up to the aspirations of the people who had been exposed to several centuries of injustice, social exploitation and discrimination, as well as two centuries of colonial dominance. Moreover, it had to be applicable and acceptable to people belonging to diverse religious, political and regional sections. However, once the transfer of power was effected, the work of the Constituent Assembly progressed steadily and smoothly in an atmosphere of order and freedom. The Assembly conducted its business in a real democratic manner- discussions were encouraged, great tolerance was shown towards criticism and no attempt was made to rush through. The motto with which the constitution-making exercise was undertaken was 'consensus', rather than the 'majority principle'. The Constituent Assembly appointed a total of 22 committees to deal with different tasks of constitution- making. Out of these, eight major committees and their chairmen were as follows: Major Committees of the Constituent Assembly S. No. Committee Headed by Drafting Committee Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Union Powers Committee Jawaharlal Nehru Union Constitution Committee Jawaharlal Nehru Provincial Constitution Committee Sardar Vallabhai Patel Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minori- Sardar Vallabhai Patel ties and Tribal and Excluded Areas Rules of Procedure Committtee Dr. Rajendra Prasad States Committee (Committee for Negotiating with Jawaharlal Nehru States) Steering Committee Dr. Rajendra Prasad WORK OF THE CONSTITUIENT ASSEMBLY- TIMELINE 9h December 1946: The first meeting of the Constituent Assembly was held in the constitution hall (now the Central Hall of Parliament House) in an atmosphere of uncertainty due to the absence of the Muslim League members who boycotted the meeting over the demand for Pakistan. Yet, the Assembly made substantial progress and appointed the oldest member of the Assembly Sachchidananda Sinha as its first interim two-day President in accordance with French practice. 11h December 1946: The Assembly elected Dr. Rajendra Prasad as its permanent President. Harendra Coomar Mookerjee was elected as Vice President (he later became the first Governor of Bengal after India became a republic). Jurist B.N. Rao was appointed Constitutional Advisor to the Assembly (he later presented the First draft of the Constitution. A detailed draft was later presented by B.R. Ambedkar, Chairman of the Drafting Committee). 13th December 1946: Jawaharlal Nehru moved his famous Objectives Resolution' which declared the Assembly's firm resolve for an 'independent Sovereign Republic' and later became the Preamble of the Constitution. 22nd July 1947: The National flag was adopted. 15" August 1947: India gained independence as the Dominion of India. 29th August 1947: Drafting Committee appointed with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar as the Chairman. 16th July 1948: Along with H.C. Mookerjee, V.T. Krishnamachari was also elected as second Vice-President of Constituent Assembly. 26h November 1949: Constitution passed, adopted and enacted by the Assembly and authenticated by the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, Dr Rajendra Prasad. Certain provisions relating to citizenship, elections, provisional parliament and transitional provisions came into force on 26 November 1949 itself while the major part of the constitution came into force on 26 January 1950. 24th January 1950: 'Jana Gana Mana' adopted as the national anthem, and the first two verses of 'Vande Mataram' the national song. Rajendra Prasad elected the first President of India. The Assembly was chaired by Dr. Rajendra Prasad when it met as a constitu- ent body, and was chaired by G. V. Mavlankar when It completed the task of drafting a constitution in two years, 11 months and 18 days. Meanwhile, 554 princely states merged with the Republic of India. met as a legislative body. On 26h January 1950, the Constitution of India came into force and repealed the Government of India Act 1935 (as the chief governing document of the country). It also repealed the Indian Independence Ac: and thus India ceased to be a dominion of the British Crown and became a sovereign democratic republic. The date of 26™ January was chosen to commemorate the Purna Swaraj declaration of independence of 1930. We continue to celebrate this day as the Republic Day. It is, indeed, creditable that the Members of the Constituent Assembly completed the task of finalising a Constitution within a period of three years even as it took many more years for other countries to have their first Constitution. It again goes to the credit of the constitution makers and their broad vision that the Constitution of India was never abrogated, and a new one introduced. The Indian Constitution was never seriously questioned since the time it came into force. The changing requirements were attended to through effecting amendments to the Constitution while its essential features were retained; they occasionally came under strain, though.

India and the Commonwealth A striking decision taken by independent India at this time was to agree to remain a full member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, the Commonwealth was simply meant to be a free association of independent members and India could leave it any time it liked. No decision or treaty of a member of the Commonwealth would be binding on India without its express consent. Thus, membership to the Commonwealth did not come in the way of its sovereign republican character in any way. Significantly, Britain also declared that the British citizens in future were to be described as 'Commonwealth Citizens' (British Nationality Act 1949). Secondly, there were practical considerations as well. For instance, India and Britain shared deep seated ties in ideas and institutions. India had significant economic ties with Britain and membership to the Commonwealth would have also meant continuation of preferential tarifl's. There were also many Indians who had settled in Commonwealth countries. Thus, past associations, common political faith, economic interests and fear of isolation were some of the main reasons which induced India to remain in the commonwealth. Though India recognised the British monarch as the head of the Commonwealth, it did not create any allegiance of the Indians to the British monarch. The Constitution of India did not even make a mention of India's commonwealth membership. Clearly, the membership had no legal sanction behind it and could be dropped any time as easily as it had been declared. CONSTITUTION OF INDIA CONSTITUTION OF INDIA Fig. 2.4 The original Constitution of India is hand-written with beautiful calligraphy, done by Prem Behari Narain Raizda. Each page is beautified and illustrated by artists from Shantiniketan including Nandalal Bose and Beohar Rammanohar Sinha. The illustrations in the document represent styles from different civilisations of the subcontinent ranging from the Indus Valley to the present times. The original book is kept in a special helium-filled case in the Library of the Parliament of India. The Constituent Assembly finalised the Constitution of India on 26th November 1949 and it came into force on 26th January 1950. It is universally acclaimed for its liberal and democratic spirits which reflects the progressive outlook and idealism of its founders. It is the supreme law of India. It enshrines the will of the people of the country and sets the broad functional parameters of governance. It imparts constitutional supremacy and not parliamentary supremacy as it was created by a Constituent Assembly and not by the Parliament. Hence, Parliament cannot override the constitution. The Constitution essentially provides a framework for a democratic and parliamentary form of government. The commitment of many nationalists to socialism is also reflected in the constitution which has a socialist tilt. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar is widely considered as its chief architect and known as the 'Father of the Indian Constitution'. The Constitution of India is the biggest written constitution the world. It is an elaborate and bulky document, originally containing 395 Articles arranged in twenty two Parts and eight Schedules. Since then, several amendments have been made from time to time. Salient Features of the Constitution Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic The Preamble of the constitution declares India as a 'Sovercign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic'. Sovereignty means absolute independence i.e., a government which is not controlled by any other power, internal or external. The entire freedom struggle aimed at the attainment of this quintessential principle of sovereignty. The sovereignty in India rests with the people and is exercised through the institutions that have been created for the purpose. The words Socialist' and 'Secular' were not there in the original Preamble but were added by the 42nd Amendment. Socialism means commitment to ideals like removal of inequalities, provision of minimum basic necessities to al, equal pay for equal work, etc. Secularism in Indian context implies several things including absence of any state-religion, separation of religion from the state, neutrality of state with regard to all religions, equal respect towards all religions, treatment of religion as a private matter for the individual, freedom of religion and absence of discrimination based on religion. Democracy is simply defined as government of the people, by the people and for the people. It essentially means that the government is elected by the people and is accountable to them. Democracy in India is achieved through various principles including universal adult franchise, system of elections, fundamental rights, etc. Republic means a state with an elected head of the state as opposed to a monarch or a hereditary ruler. Universal Adult Franchise As an ultimate success of democratic rule, the Constitution of India provides for universal adult franchise. The constitution makers showed immense faith in the common man and adopted the principle of adult suffrage in a largely poor and illiterate society. Granville Austin, has described direct elections by adult suffrage like a 'gong, the single note, whose reverberations might awaken- or at least stir- sleeping India'. The extent of advance made by the constitution may be appreciated when we recall that till the end of British rule, franchise remained immensely restricted by property, education and other qualifications to just about 15% of the country's population. Union of States Notably, India is constituted as a *union of States' and not a 'federation of States'. The Drafting Committee had clarified that though India was to be a federation, the federation was not the result of an agreement by the States to join in a federation, and that the federation not being the result of an agreement, no state has the right to secede from it. The federation is a union because it is indestructible. Hence the constitution odes use the term 'federal state' anywhere. The decision of the constitution makers to go for a strong Union Government (Centre) within a federal framework was also influenced by the circumstances in which it was taken. The Union Powers Committee headed by Nehru, had initially provided for a very weak Central Government. But once the 3rd June Plan was announced and the decision on partition was taken, it quickly moved in the direction of a federation with a strong Center. Hence, India's Constitution has both unitary (centralising) and federal (de-centralising) features. Unitary features present include strong center, single citizenship and single unified judiciary. Federal features include distribution of powers between the Union Government and the States and presence of three lists of subjects (the Union List, the State List and the Concurrent List). Hence, the Indian constitution does not fit into any rigid definition of federal or unitary and is also sometimes termed as 'quasi-federal'. Moreover, Indian federalism has certain distinctive features. For instance, the federalism is asymmetric i.e., the devolved powers to all the states are not uniform. Jammu and Kashmir has been awarded higher degree of autonomy; the Union Territories are directly governed by the Union government; and Delhi and Puducherry have been accorded their own legislatures. Hence, the system introduced by the constitution is also sometimes termed as 'cooperative federalism'. Relative Flexibility This feature refers to the amenability of the constitution. The writers of Indian constitution were of the view that a Constitution is a living document and, hence, it has to reflect the changing times. In fact, the occasion for debate regarding the basic features of the Constitution arose when certain amendments were made to the Constitution. Thus, the Constitution of India is not rigid unlike that in some other countries and provides room for amendment. The amendment procedure laid down in the Constitution is both rigid and soft for different articles. The supremacy of the Indian Parliament vis-à-vis the Constitution and the Supreme Court has often been a matter of controversy. It was, in the final analysis, resolved that Parliament is rightfully authorised to amend the constitution, but only so long as it did not amend the 'basic features of the Constitution. Besides, the Supreme Court has the power to decide whether an amendment to the Constitution, indeed, were against the basic features of the Constitution or not. Written Constitution The Constitution of India is a written document unlike the British constitution which is unwritten. It is also the lengthiest constitution in the world. The original constitution had 395 Articles and eight Schedules, while, the constitution of USA has only seven Articles. Main Provisions The Constitution of India was not an original document and the framers of the Constitution freely borrowed the good features of other constitutions particularly those of the UK, the USA, Canada and Ireland. The Preamble of the Constitution is an introduction or preface to the constitution. It contains the guiding principles, the philosophy, the spirit or the essence of the constitution. The very first words clearly indicate the source from which the document derives its authority, i.e. 'We, the people of India'. It also establishes the objectives of the constitution and is based on the 'Objectives Resolution' drafted and moved by Jawaharlal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly on 13th December 1946. As is clear from the text of the Preamble, the sovereign authority in India is vested in the people. Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity are the principle objectives of the constitution. The parts on Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy contain elaborate provisions to give shape to these objectives. The ordering of these objectives also indicates the priority given to socio-economic justice which was perhaps considered the most fundamental aspect of the constitution. Is Preamble a Part of the Constitution? Whether the Preamble is a part of the constitution or not has been a matter of controversy. In the Berubari Case (1960), the Supreme Court originally stated that the preamble is not an integral part of the Constitution and therefore it is not enforceable in a court of law. However, in the Kesavananda Case (1973), the Supreme Court overruled the earlier decision and upheld that the Preamble was an integral part of the Constitution and may be used to interpret ambiguous areas of the document. (Institutions of Governance and thelr Worklng) Union Government The three organs or branches of any government include legislature, executive and judiciary. The Union Executive In India, the legislature and the executive are drawn from one another, while the judiciary is an independent body. The Union Executive consists of the President, the Vice-President and the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at its head. • The President- The executive power of the Union is vested in the President and is exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. Hence, all activities of the state are carried out in the name of the President. His position is comparable to that of the King under the British constitution- He is head of the state but not of the executive; he represents but not rules the nation. He is elected by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the States in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. The Office of the President, manner of election and re-election, term of office, qualifications for election, impeachment, etc. are enunciated in Articles 52 to 62. As in the United States, in India, too, the President is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The President summons both the houses of Parliament and addresses its joint sessions. He appoints all the important functionaries of the state such as the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, the Attorney General, Governors of States, Chairpersons of Commissions like the Election Commission of India and heads of organisations like the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG). He has the power to grant pardons, etc. and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases. Though normally a figurehead, unstable or ambiguous political situations may provide ample opportunity to the President to use presidential discretion leading to potential abuse of powers. For instance, President's activism with regard to the dismissal of state governments and imposition of President's rule has evoked much controversy in the past. • The Vice President- He is the ex-officio Chairman of the Council of States. The Vice-President acts as President or to discharge his functions during casual vacancies in the office, or during the absence, of President. Articles 63 to 70 deal with the office of the Vice-President, tenure, method of election etc. There were two occasions when Presidents, Dr. Zakir Hussain and Fakhruddin Ahmed died in office and Vice Presidents V.V. Giri and B.D. Jatti had to step in. • The Council of Ministers- The Constitution states that there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President in the exercise of his functions. It further states that the Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the ndvice of the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People,: • The Prime Minister- In practice, the President appoints as Prime Minister the leader of the party that has a majority in the Lok Sabha or, if no party has a clear majority, a person who can prove the confidence of the majority of the members of the Lok Sabha. Other Ministers are chosen by the Prime Minister 'and appointed by the President. Even those persons who are not Members of Parliament may be appointed as ministers, on the condition that they become a member of either house of Parliament within six months. In this way, almost all powers formally vested in the President are in reality exercised by the Prime Minister. Thus, the real executive power under the constitution vests in the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the head of Government and he presides over the meetings of the Union Council of Ministers which is collectively responsible to the House of the People. The Union Legislature (Parliament) After Independence, India chose to adopt a parliamentary form of government. In such a form of government, the President is the Head of the State while real executive power is exercised by the head of the Government, i.e., the Prime Minister, in association with his Council of Ministers, all of who are collectively responsible to the Parliament. Thus, the legislature of the Union is known as the Parliament (Article 79) which consists of the President and two Houses, known respectively as the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and the House of the People (Lok Sabha). The main function of the Parliament is to make laws for the country and to find finances for the running of the Government. In fact, the Parliament is the highest law-making body in the country and it alone has the power to amend the constitution including Fundamental Rights. Clearly, the constitution had envisaged the Parliament as an institution commanding great power and prestige. However, in recent years, it is seen that some members indulge in unnecessary shouting, walkouts and even physical scuffles, lowering the dignity of the Parliament and delaying legislation work. Questions have been raised on the productivity of Parliament sessions at the cost of taxpayers' money. Another matter of concern is the persistent demand for reservation for various sections of people in parliament, notwithstanding the fact that the constitution itself had envisaged reservations as a short-term measure lasting ten years. The practice of reservations has shown that once the principle is accepted, it is not only impossible to reverse and also encourages other groups to claim similar benefits, thus perpetuating group-identities. However, the current political scenario is such that even questioning the desirability of reservations has become difficult. The Judiciary The third organ of the government is the Judiciary. Constitutional Articles 124-147 and 214-237 lay down the entire framework of the judicial system in India. Accordingly, India has a single unified judicial system which stands like a pyramid with the lower courts as the base, High Courts in the middle and the Supreme Court at the top. Prior to the establishment of Supreme Court of India in January 1950, the highest court of appeal was the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain (abolished in October 1949). The Constitution states that there shall be a Supreme Court of India consisting of a Chief Justice of India and, until Parliament by law prescribes a larger number, of not more than seven (now 30) other Judges. The Supreme Court of India is the highest judicial forum of India, it is the final court of appeal and is the custodian of the Constitution. Laws enacted legislature can be declared void by the Supreme Court, if it finds them in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. This power is known as the power of 'judicial review' or 'constitutional review'. Besides, the Supreme Court has extensive original, appellate and advisory jurisdictions. the Government in the States and Union Territories The system of government in the States closely resembles that of the Union. The State Executive consists of the Governor assisted by a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at its head. The Constitution states that the Governor of a State shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal. The Governor shall hold office during the pleasure of the President. The term of office of the Governor is five years. No person shall be eligible for appointment as Governor unless he is a citizen of India and has complcted the age of thirty-five years. The Constitution further states that there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion. The Chief Minister shall be appointed by the Governor and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister, and the Ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor. The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State. Thus, like the President, the Governor is meant to be a constitutional head. However, in case of failure of constitutional machinery in state and imposition of the President's rule (under Article 356), the governor assumes real powers and emerges as the effective executive. Over the years, this power of the Governor has also evoked much controversy. All political parties are guilty of appointing pliant governors (as opposed to non-partisan 'outsiders') who have tended to act more as agents of the Centre and even conspired in toppling state governments. The desirable convention of consulting the state Chief Minister before appointing the Governor has also been overlooked. The Union Territories, seven in number, are directly administered by lieutenant governors appointed by the President. Delhi and Puducherry are two union territories with their own legislatures. Local Government Though the constitution does not lay down the exact form of local government, the Directive Principles clearly instruct the state to 'take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government' (Article 40). Accordingly, the local government in India has evolved from Community Development Programme in the 1950s to three-tier Panchaynti Raj system constitutionalised by the 73 and 74th Amendments in 1993. Services under the Union and the States The Constitution also provides for various services under the union and the states and setting up of Public Service Commissions for the Union and for the States (Part XIV). Rules for recruitment and conditions of service including constitutional guarantees against arbitrary dismissal have also been laid down. Thus, the colonial structure of administration (including all-India services, state services and central services) was retained; the Indian Civil Service was replaced by the Indian Administrative Service. But why did free-India retain the steel frame of British administration? Perhaps the main reason lies in the chaos accompanying freedom and partition. The ambiguous position of princely states, the communal riots, the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi... all seemed to push India to the very edge of disintegration. Amidst such confusion, the one factor of stability and predictability appeared to be the administrative structure. "Basic Structure' of the Constitution The Constitution is supposed to have a 'basic structure' which cannot be altered. This was spelt out by the Supreme Court in the majority judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973). According to the judgement, there are certain basic features of the Indian Constitution which cannot be amended. If an amendment seeks to alter this structure, the Court may declare it as ultra vires (beyond one's legal authority) as the word 'amend' in Article 368 means only changes other than altering the very structure of the Constitution, which be tantamount to making a new constitution. The power of the Parliament to amend the basic structure came into sharp focus at the time of Emergency. The present position is that the court can declare any amendment to the Constitution as ultra vires if it believes that it alters any basic feature of the constitution. The features included in the 'basic structure' of the Constitution are supremacy of the constitution; the republican and democratic form of government; secular character of the Constitution; separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary; principle of free and fair elections; the rule of law; objectives specified in the Preamble; judicial review; freedom and dignity of the individual; unity and integrity of the nation; principle of equality; concept of social and economic justice; the balance between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles; the independence of judiciary and effective access to justice. While there are differences among judges regarding the contents of the above list, there is doctrine of 'basic structure' or 'basic features'. nsensus over the "CONCLUSION Over the years, voices have emanated from various corners regarding changes required to be made in the Constitution, leading to the appointment of the National Commission to: Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) by the BJP- led NDA government in 2000. Significantly, recommendations were sought without changing the 'basic structure' or 'basic features' of the constitution, amply demonstrating the extent to which the constitution has succeeded in commanding respect, even from its critics. Granville Austin- "India would do as she had done for centuries: take what she desired from other cultures and bend it to her needs." Bipan Chandra- "We cannot lay our failures at the door of the constitution; where there are failures, as indeed there are many, it is not the Constitution that has failed us, it is we who have failed the Constitution."  
   
   
   
    Post Independence India The India Independence Act, 1947 provided for the transfer of power on the basis of grant of Dominion status to two successor states of India and Pakistan and the lapse of paramountcy over Indian States. The Independence Bill was rushed through the Parliament in a short period of 12 days (4th July to 16th July), receiving the royal assent on 18th July 1947. From the Mountbatten Plan of 3rd June to 15" August 1947 i.e., in 72 days both the transfer of power and the partition of the country were hurried through at lightning speed. The deteriorating communal situation seemed to have prompted Mountbatten to transfer power at the earliest and forsake responsibility of further disorder. From the Indian standpoint, this proved disastrous, particularly in Punjab, where migrations took place in a frenzy and culminated in massacres. Hence the partition of India and the manner in which it was carried out created a host of socio-political, economic and   administrative problems, apart from flaming the fire of communal hatred in the two newly independent states. At the stroke of midnight on 14th-15th August 1947, India became independent. A special session of the Constituent Assembly was held that night, chaired by its president Rajendra Prasad. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India addressed the assembly and gave his famous Tryst with Destiny' speech. On the morning of 15th August, free India woke up to the dual reality of Independence and Partition. The year 1947 witnessed unprecedented violence associated with partition and trauma of displacement. In fact, the Partition of India was to cast a long shadow over nearly every aspect of national life, whether social, economic or political. It was in this backdrop that India embarked upon its post independence journey. INDEPENDENCE DAY (15" AUGUST) The day of 15h August 1947 was chosen by Mountbatten as the day for transfer of power since it marked the second anniversary of the Japanese surrender to the Allied forces in World War II. Also because the next preferred date of 26" January 1948 would have been too late. However, 15th August was declared by astrologers as inauspicious and hence it was decided to begin the celebrations a day earlier, on 14th August itself. On the midnight of 14th August, a Special Session of the Constituent Assembly, the body of Indians working towards a new constitution, was called. The proceedings began at 11 pm, with the singing of Vande Matram' followed by speeches made by three main speakers namely Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman (who represented the Muslims of India and pledged the loyalty of the minority to India), Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Jawaharlal Nehru. At the stroke of midnight, India was granted Independence. The session ended with the presentation of the national flag on behalf of the women of India. After the session, Nehru submitted to the Governor General, his list of cabinet ministers comprising of 13 other ministers apart from the Prime Minister. Notably, the list included names of those who were not from the Congress. These were B.R. Ambedkar (a legal luminary and a leader of the Scheduled Castes), Syama Prasad Mookerjee (of Hindu Mahasabha) and Baldev Singh (a Sikh representative). Ambedkar and Mookerjee had been lifelong adversaries of the Congress. Gandhi had reminded Nehru that 'freedom has come to India, not to the Congress' and had urged him to form a Cabinet that included the ablest men regardless of party affiliations. Nehru and his men had wisely acted on Gandhi's advice and put aside the differences. On 15h August, the first item on the agenda was the swearing in of the Governor General, Lord Mountbatten (who, until the previous night had been the last Viceroy. Later C. Rajagopalachari served as the Governor General from 21N June 1948 until 26" January 1950 when Rajendra Prasad was elected as the first President of India). This was followed by the swearing in of the ministers and procession of ministers to the Constituent Assembly.  First Cabinet of Independent India (First Nehru Ministry, 15th August 1947-15th April 1952) Independent India's first Cabinet which began functioning from 15th August comprised of 14 ministers in all. By the time it was dissolved, i.e. on 15h April 1952, many new faces had joined the ministry.

CHALLENGES OF NATION BUILDING On the eve of Independence, India faced three broad challenges- • Challenge #1- Consolidating India as a Nation • Challenge #2- Establishing a Democratic Polity • Challenge #3- Socio-Economic Development Challenge #1- Consolidating India as a Nation The first and foremost challenge that India faced immediately after Independence was to weld India into one nation, yet accommodate the diversity in our society. India is a land of continental size and mind-boggling diversity. The partition of the country appeared to prove everyone's worst fears. Serious questions were raised regarding India's future. Would India even survive as one nation? Would it mean rejecting all sub-national identities? How was the integration of the territory of India to be achieved? In fact, in the wake of Partition and communal riots, many observers had predicted growing disunity or even disintegration of India. The need of the hour, thus, was to first respond to the challenge of Partition and displacement and then secure the unity of the nation by tackling the major areas of diversity that produced conflicts (which included the diverse Indian States, Indian languages and Indian tribes). Fig. 3.2 Rural Sikhs in a long oxcart train headed towards India (1947). Rehabilitation of Refugees As per the Mountbatten Plan (the Partition Plan), the Legislative Assemblies of Bengal and Punjab were to meet in two sections (representing Muslim majority districts and the rest of province) to decide by a simple majority whether the province was to be partitioned or not. In case they vote for partition, two dominions and two constituent assemblies shall be created. The members decided in favour of partition and two Boundary Commissions were constituted, one in respect of each province. The Commissions, headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, worked under conditions of   serious limitations. Not only did Justice Radcliffe have 'no knowledge about India', he had to finalise the boundaries within a six-week deadline. As such, the Radcliffe Line was an artificial line superimposed on the socio-cultural landscape and cut across villages, farmlands and even houses; giving rise to numerous visible and invisible problems. Further, even though the Boundary Commission Award was ready by 12th August, Mountbatten withheld the announcement until transfer of power, to forsake responsibility of further disorder (the Award was published only on 17™ August). As a result, people living in the villages between Lahore and Amritsar continued to live in their homes thinking that they were on the right side of the border. Once the award was announced at the last minute, violence broke out on both sides of the border in Punjab. Though it has never been conclusively established who began the massacres, armed bands of Muslims and Sikhs roamed the cities of Punjab committing unbelievable murders. The Punjab carnage in the month of August 1947 convinced the common man that only solution to communal violence was physical separation of the Hindus, Muslims and the Sikhs. Thus began one of the largest, most abrupt and unplanned transfer of population in human history. By the time the movement of refugees came to an end (November 1947), an estimated 80 lakh refugees had crossed the border. The governments of both India and Pakistan had to face the unprecedented problems of feeding, clothing and rehabilitating the refugees. The government of India set a Department of Rehabilitation and planned a number of new colonies in and around Delhi. 9. Besides administrative and financial concerns, the partition posed another deeper concern. It challenged the very idea of a secular India. Even after partition, Muslims accounted for 12% of the total population in 1951. How was the government of India going to treat its Muslims citizens and other religious minorities? Indian leaders, as you would learn, remained firm in their belief in secularism and the ideal was enshrined in the constitution. 1.1, Fig. 3.3 A refugee special train at Ambala Station during partition. Over 10 million people were uprooted from their homeland and travelled on foot, bullock carts arıd trains to their promised new home.  Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi (30th January 1948) Though deeply aggrieved by the partition of India, Gandhi continued to believe in the ideal of Indian nationhood based on secular terms where people of all communities enjoyed equal rights. On 15th August 1947, when the whole nation was immersed in festivities, Gandhi was in Calcutta observing a 24-hour fast, holding prayer meetings and trying to stop communal violence. He camped in a *ramshackle building open on all sides to the crowds' in the Muslim dominated locality of Beliaghata. Within days, the results were there for everyone to notice. Calcutta, that had been rioting since August last year (when the Muslim League had unleashed 'direct action' in a desperate attempt to polarise the two communities and force British to divide India), was peaceful on 15th August 1947 to everyone's relief and surprise. Lord Mountbatten had remarked, "In the Punjab we have 55 thousand soldiers and large-scale rioting on our hands. In Bengal our forces consist of one man, and there is no rioting." However, by end of August, riots flared up in Bengal and Gandhi decided to go on fast. "But how can you fast against the goondas?" asked a friend. "And if you die, the conflagration will be worse." To which Gandhi replied, "At least 1 won't be there to witness it. 1 shall have done my bit." Gandhi began his fast on 2nd September and by next day Hindu and Muslim rioters were coming to him and laying down their arms. Gandhi finally broke his fast (which had lasted for three days) after a deputation of leaders from the Muslim League, the Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha assured him that there shall be no further rioting. On 7h September, having spent nearly a month in Beliaghata, Gandhi left for Delhi from where he planned to move on to Punjab and Lahore and eventually restore peace along the western border as well. But when Gandhi arrived in Delhi, he found the Muslim community threatened with extinction, specially at the hands of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan. Gandhi had planned to proceed to Punjab in order to make the Muslims stop perpetrating violence against the Hindus and the Sikhs. But he could not hope to do so, unless he could secure justice for the Muslims in Delhi. He therefore decided to put the Punjab programme on hold and moved by his inner conscience, he took up the cause of the Muslim community. He begged the Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs to bring peace quickly to Delhi so that he could proceed to Punjab. At the initiative of Gandhi-Nehru combine, the Congress passed a resolution on the 'rights of minorities' to the effect that- the party had never accepted the two-nation theory, it still believed that India is a land Fig. 3.4 Gandhi touring Bela in Bihar, a communal riot stricken village. Shown with him is Badshah Khan (March 1947).  of many religions and many races and ust remain so. Whatever be the situation in Pakistan, India would be a democratic secular State where all religions enjoy full rights and are equally entitled to the protection of the state, irrespective of the religion to which they belong. However, the RSS was skeptical of this view and its second sarsangchalak (Supreme Leader) named M.S. Golwalkar had explicitly mentioned in his book We or Our Nationhood Defined' published in 1939- the non-Hindu people of Hindustan must either adopt Hindu culture and language, must learn and respect and hold in reverence the Hindu religion, must entertain no idea but of those of glorification of the Hindu race and culture...in a word they must cease to be foreigners, or may stay in the country, wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation, claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, far less any preferential treatment-not even citizens' rights.' As attacks on Muslims continued, Gandhi chose to go on another fast beginning 13th January and addressed to three different subjects. The first were the people of India, specially the people of Delhi to whom he appealed to restore peace and brotherhood. The second was the Government of Pakistan to which he once again appealed to put an end to the state of affairs (i.e., stop driving out the minorities). The third was the government of India which had withheld Pakistan's share of the 'sterling balance' which the British owed to undivided India on account of India's contribution during WW2. New Delhi had not released the money (amounting to 7550 million) following Pakistan's doings in Kashmir. Gandhi saw this as unnecessarily revengeful and made the ending of his fast conditional on the transfer of this money to Pakistan. On 15th January, New Delhi decided to release the money. The next day, more than 1000 refugees signed a declaration saying that they would welcome back the displaced Muslims of Delhi. On his previous visits, though Gandhi had resided in sweepers' colony, this time, however he was put up at the home of his millionaire follower G.D. Birla. On 30th January 1948, as Gandhi prepared to start his daily prayer meeting at Birla House mansion in New Delhi, he was shot dead by Nathuram Godse, a right-wing advocate of Hindu nationalism. "The light has gone out of our lives and there is darkness everywhere...the father of the nation is no more...", Nehru had mourned. The Mahatma's death united the whole country in a wave of mourning. Of particular significance was the coming together of Nehru and Patel, the differences between whom had begun to grow louder lately. Both now appealed to the nation for unity and forgiveness. Godse was later tried and hanged to death. During his trial, Godse had justified his act and had claimed that his main provocation was the Mahatma's 'constant and consistent pandering to the Muslims', 'culminating in his last pro-Muslim fast (which) at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately'. In the aftermath of Gandhi's assassination, the RSS was banned. But when the investigators could find no evidence that the RSS had formally sponsored or even knew of Godse's plot, the ban was lifted in 1949.   Nehru vs. Patel The ruling political party of free India faced threats from within as well as from outside. Its two main stalwarts, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel had come to loggerheads soon after Independence. Though Gandhi's death had brought them together, the amity was brief and differences emerged soon after, In terms of character and personality, they were a picture of contrasts in certain ways- while Nehru had an appreciation for good food and wine, fine art and literature; Patel was a teetotaler and a 'hard-task master with little time for play'. He had a grave exterior and was once described as 'leather tough' by the New York Times. They were also' similar in certain ways- both were fierce patriots, both were politicians of integrity and both had a daughter as their companion and chief confidante. In terms of views, while Nehru was an avowed socialist, Patel was friendly with capitalists. While Nehru was a staunch advocate of non- alignment, Patel was rather inclined to support the Western Block in the emerging Cold War. While Nehru felt that it was the responsibility of the Congress and the government to make the Muslims in India feel secure, Patel was more inclined to place the responsibility on the minorities themselves. He had once stated, "Muslim citizens in India have 'a responsibility to remove the doubts and misgivings entertained by a large section of the people about their loyalty founded largely on their past association with the demand for Pakistan and the unfortunate activities ,, of some of them." Emergence of Nehru 'as the Undisputed Leader The death of the Mahatma created a sort of political vacuum in national politics. Though both Nehru and Sardar Patel were revered by the masses, Patel's death in December 1950 cleared the decks for the rise of Nehru (who was also the Mahatma's chosen political heir) as the undisputed leader- one who was to continue in office unopposed for 17 long years until his death on 27h May 1964. The weight of Nehru's views and personality. was, such that it left an indelible mark on the development trajectory of young India. Percival Griffiths "Nehru has at, certain enigmatic quality, defying analysis...by. temperament at once a democrat and a dictator...it is impossible to be with him without realizing his greatness and his singleness of purpose." Ramachandra Guha "Gandhi could not reconcile, in life, Hindu with Muslim, but he did reconcile, through his death, Jawaharlal Nehru Fig. 3.5 Jawaharlal Nehru with Mahatma with Vallabhbhai Patel." Gandhi   "Bengal had a long history of often bloody conflict between Hindus and Muslims, dating back to (at least) the last decades of the nineteenth century. By contrast, in the Punjab the different communities had lived more or less in peace-there were no significant clashes on religious grounds before 1947." Yet, at the time of partition, there was a 'Punjab Carnage' while Calcutta remained relatively quiet. Comment. The difference is attributed to several reasons- Firstly, Calcutta was relatively quiet due to the presence of Mahatma Gandhi. Given the history of Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta, Gandhi camped there for nearly a month (7h August to 7th September, 1947) and personally made efforts for maintenance of communal harmony. Secondly, large sections of Hindu middle class in Bengal actively sought partition. For several decades now, Hindu professionals had been making their way to western Bengal along with landlords who sold their holdings to invest in property or business near the provincial capital of Calcutta. On the other hand, the large Hindu community in Punjab mainly comprised of merchants and money lenders who were closely tied to the agrarian classes and were unwilling to relocate. Thirdly, in Punjab, the Muslims were pitted against the no less militant Sikhs who had shared a history of persecution at the hands of the Muslims. Further, at the turn of the century, the British had asked the Sikhs from eastern Punjab to settle in the new 'canal colonies' in the west where the Sikhs had soon built prosperous settlements. Why .should they leave the now? There were substantial communities of Sikh farmers in both parts of the province and they were in no mood to choose. Thus, unlike the Hindus of Bengal, the Sikhs of Punjab were slow to fully understand the reality of partition. As the reality of partition dawned upon them, rather than choosing between the Hindus and the Muslims, they preferred to have a separate Sikh state for themselves, to be called 'Khalistan'. Fourthly, while the Boundary Commission Award was announced before 15th August in Bengal, the announcement was delayed in Punjab and heightened the uncertainties. Further, the Award was prepared by Sir Radcliffe who worked under conditions of extreme limitations. He had no prior knowledge of India and its people (which was thought to be an advantage). He had to finalise the lines in both east and west within a short period of five weeks. In this task, he was aided by outdated maps and census returns. As a result, the Award enraged the Muslims who felt that Gurdaspur district should have gone to Pakistan. Angrier still were the Sikhs, whose Nankana Saheb (birthplace of tlhe founder of their religion) now lay in the homeland of the Muslims.  Integration of Princely Slates The Indian Independence Act contained the following provision regarding Indian States, "All treaties, agreements, etc. between His Majesty's Government and the rulers of Indian States shall lapse. The words 'Emperor of India' shall be omitted from Royal Styles and Titles. The Indian States will be free to accede to either of the new dominion of India or Pakistan". This provision did not make clear the position of Princely States regarding the option of independence, 'leaving to luxuriate in wild dreams of independent power'! At the last hour, it was announced that with the end of British rule in India, the British paramountcy over princely states would also lapse and the states would become independent entities. The British government Fig. 3.6 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, took the view that all these states, 565 in all, would be free to join either India or Pakistan or remain independent if they wished so. This decision, was left not to the people of the states but to the rulers of these states. Clearly, the position of princely states was a matter of grave concern and could threaten the very idea of a united India. Soon enough, the ruler of Travancore announced that the state had decided to remain independent. A similar announcement was made by the Nizam of Hyderabad the next day. The National Provisional Government (or, the Interim Government) took a firm view against the possible division of India into a number of small principalities. At this juncture, Sardar Patel, who was India's Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, played a historic role. He and his chief aide, V.P. Menon, urged the Indian princes to show their patriotism and join the Indian Union by signing the Instrument of Accession (whereby the states would surrender the three subjects Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communications. After they acceded, they were asked to 'integrate' i.e., dissolve their states as independent entities and merge with the Union of India. In exchange, they could retain their titles and enjoy an allowance in perpetuity. Several Maharajas were also appointed Governors of provinces). Urged by the nationalists, Mountbatten too decided to throw the weight of his personality and office behind Sardar Patel. In a speech made to the Chamber of Princes, Mountbatten clarified that the Independence Act had released the States from all their obligations to the crown, leaving them 'technically independent or so to say, rudderless, on their own'. The old links were broken and if nothing was put in its place, chaos would result. He therefore advised them to forge links with the new nation closest to them. First Deputy Prime Minister of India. Finally, Sardar Patel succeeded in getting a vast majority of states to accede to the Indian Union through a combination of persuasion, diplomacy, threat of  popular movements and even some arm twisting. By 15h August 1947, as many as 136 states had acceded to the Indian Union. However, accession of Hyderabad, Junagarh, Kashmir and Manipur was more difficult than the rest. Kashmir signed the Instrument of Accession on 26th October 1947, Junagarh and Hyderabad 'in 1948, Manipur in 1949. The French authorities ceded French enclaves of Pondicherry and Chandernagore to India on 1st November 1954. Portuguese enclaves of Góa, Daman and Diu were liberated by the Indian Army and annexed on 19th December 1961. When the British withdrew from India, they left behind more than 500 pieces of scattered territory in the form of 'princely states' (the states were so many that there was even a disagreement regarding their number!) and the spectre of India reverting to 18th century polity loomed large. During 1946-47, Nehru was the President of the All-India States Peoples Conference. Nehru had a severe dislike for the feudal autocracy of the Indian States and the States' rulers, in turn, disliked Nehru. Fortunately, not only was the problem of the States assigned to the pragmatic Patel, but also the forces of nationalism seemed irresistible this time. Throughout 1947, Patel threw a series of lunches, urging the princes to join the Constituent Assembly. As early as February 1947, the first chiefdom to join the Constituent Assembly was Baroda. In April, Bikaner, led by its Maharaja and diwan K.M. Panikkar (the famous historian) issued an appeal to fellow princes to join the Assembly. Following the appeal, several Rajput States of Rajasthan (many of whom also shared a border with Pakistan) fell in line 'in a fresh act of traditional obeisance to Delhi' where in place of a Mughal or British, a Pandit now ruled. On 27th June 1947, the new States Department was set up by the government of India, replacing the old Political Department, with Patel as Minister and V.P. Menon as Secretary. In July, the Congress trinity comprising of Gandhi, Nehru and Patel met the Viceroy asking him to ensure that the British did not leave behind a legacy of balkanisation by encouraging the States to declare their independence. Subsequently, in a move that may be considered as the most significant contribution of Mountbatten to India, the Viceroy urged the princes to actively forge ties with the dominion nearest to them. And by 15 August, nearly all the states had signed the Instrument of Accession. However, three states (Travancore, Bhopal, Jodhpur) gave trouble before the declaration of Independence, and three more (Junagarh, Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir) afterwards,, Travancore The state of Travancore, one of the most prosperous princely states of British India, was strategically situated at the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula. It could boast off of the most literate populace in India, a flourishing maritime trade and newly discovered reserves of monazite sand from  which thorium is extracted and used in production of atomic energy and atomic bombs. In the summer of 1947, Travancore, led by its influential diwan Sir C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyar, was the first to clarify its intention of remaining independent after the lapse of British paramountcy. Given its glorious past, Sir CP wondered why Travancore should be 'in a worse position than Denmark, Switzerland and ´Siam'. It is probable that the state's ambitions of independence were fanned by politicians in England in view of the impending cold war and Travancore's ability to serve British needs (Britain had already signed an agreement with Travancore for supply of monazite). However, following a brutal attack on his life by a member of the Kerala Socialist Party, Sir CP changed his mind and advised the maharaja to accede to the Indian Union. Bhopal With the combination of mostly Hindu population and a Muslim ruler (the Nawab), Bhopal also wavered on the question of accession. The Nawab, opposed to Congress and close to Jinnah, had served as the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes since 1944 and had been an old polo-playing buddy of Mountbatten. In July 1947, he wrote a letter to the Viceroy in which he first accused the British of betrayal and then issued a warning- "I tell you straight that unless you and His Majesty's Government support the States and prevent them from disappearing from the Indian politicał map, you will very shortly have an India dominated by Communists...". It took Mountbatten a little convincing (that the Red threat could be best met if the princes and the Congress joined hands) before the Nawab finally signed the Instrument of Accession. Jodhpur Though a state with a Hindu king and largely a Hindu population, Jodhpur had nearly defected to Pakistan having been offered a carte blanche by Jinnah. It was only at the last minute that the Maharaja came around and agreed to accede to India. Junagarh Like Bhopal, Junagarh had a Muslim Nawab (Mohabat Khan) ruling over a largely Hindu population (82%). Though surrounded by India on three sides, on the fourth it had a long coast-line; its main port Veraval being very close to the Pakistani port city of Karachi. Junagarh housed the Hindu and Jain pilgrimage places of Somnath and Girnar. It was also the last refuge of the Asiatic lion. On 14th August and under the influence of its diwan, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, Junagarh announced its intention to accede to Pakistan. After sitting on the request for a few weeks, Jinnah accepted the accession on 13th September 1947 even as it flew on the face of two-nation theory and made little geographical sense! Subsequently, Samaldas Gandhi, a nephew of the Mahatma, set up a 'provisional government of Junagarh' or Aarzi Hukumat at Bombay which soon became instrumental in flaring a popular agitation within Junagarh. Out of sheer panic, the Nawab fled to Karachi leaving the diwan to seek accession with India. Even though the formal transfer took place on 9th November 1947, the government of India organized a plebiscite (20h February 1948) to establish legitimacy and won 91% voles in its favor. Hyderabad A landlocked but sprawling state in the center of the Deccan plateau and covering three linguistic zones (Telugu, Kannada and 'Marathi), Hyderabad too had a Muslim ruler (the Nizam) and a largely Hindu population (85%). While Muslims dominated the state services including police, army and administration; the bulk of the masses worked as peasants, labourers and artisans.  The Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan, Asnf Jah VII (who himself owned 10% of the state's land) was one of the richest men in the world, and also probably the most miserly. Naturally he was averse to the iden of parting with his land and wished to remain independent. To fight his case, he employed an Englishman, Sir Walter Monckton, a King's Counsel. "India could live if its Moslem limbs in the north-west and north-cast were amputated, but could it live without its midriff?" wondered the constitutional expert Reginald Coupland. The three main forces that became specially active in the state at this time were- the Hyderabad State Congress (that insisted on the representative government), the Communists. (that demanded redistribution of land) and the Ittihad-ul- Muslimeen (a powerful pro-Nizam Muslim party that supported Nizam's claims to independence and aimed to safeguard the interests of the Muslims in politics and administration). 'While the State Congress organised street protests and courted arrests, the Communists led a peasant uprising in Telangana against landlessness, forced labour and the Nizam's rule. On the other hand, the Ittihad emerged as a paramilitary force supported by the militia of "Razakars' led by Muslim radical Kasim Razvi. The Nizam and the Ittihad drew their support from the Conservative Party (led by Churchill) in' Britain as well as from Pakistan. On one hand, Churchill and his men had declared that Britain had a personal obligation to stand by the just claims of Hyderabad to remain independent. On the other hand, Jinnah had told Mountbatten that if the Congress made any attempt to take Hyderabad by force, all the hundred million Muslims of India 'would rise as one man to defend the oldest Muslim dynasty in India." However, in view of the popular disturbances, the Nizam agreed to sign a "Standstill Agreement' in November 1947 under which ties forged between Hyderabad and British government in India would be continued with its successor government. This bought time for both the parties which also deputed agents (K.M. Munshi and Mir Laik Ali) in each other's territory. Throughout the first half of 1948, tension grew and there were allegations of gunrunning from Pakistan and eastern Europe to Hyderabad. Muslims from Central Provinces began flocking to Hyderabad and were said to have chased away the Hindus in a bid to make Hyderabad a Muslim majority Flg. 3.7 (From left to right): Prime Minister Jawa- state. On 21s June 1948, Lord Mountbatten resigned from office of the governor general making it easier for Patel to take strong action. And on 13 September, Indian army harlal Nehru, Nizam VII and army chief Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri after Hyderabad's accession to India.  was sent into Hyderabad under Operation Polo on the grounds that the law and situation there threatened the peace of south India. The troops took complete control of the state in less than four days. Interestingly, the Indian action took place two days after the death of Jinnah (I1h September 1948). While the Nizam was made the Rajpramukh (governor) of the Indian state of Hyderabad, Colonel J.N. Chaudhuri of the Indian Army was hailed as the *liberator". Given the odds, the integration of numerous princely states with the Indian Union was a marvellous achievement. The position of Indian States 'afforded no parallel to or analogy with any institution known in history'. Yet, they had been integrated 'peacefully' and with little loss of life under the guiding hand of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. For his unique contribution, Sardar Patel is fondly remembered as the Iron Man of India', the 'Unifier of India' and 'Indian Bismarck'. He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1991. Since 2014, his birthday 31 October is celebrated as 'Rashtriya Ekta Diwas' (National Unity Day) every year. Kashmir Read about the accession of Kashmir later in this chapter. Also known as C. Rajagopal- Chakravarti Rajagopalachari (1878-1972) achari, Rajaji or C.R., was a lawyer, freedom fighter and statesman. Born in the Krishnagiri district of Madras presidency, he also acquired the nickname 'Mango of Krishnagiri'. He was a renowned Gandhian and was described by Gandhi as the keeper of my conscience'. As a member of the Indian National Congress, he participated in various agitations including Rowlatt Satyagraha, Non-Cooperation Movement, the Vaikom Satyagraha and the Civil Disobedience Movement during which he led the famous Vedaranyam Salt Satyagraha on the lines of Gandhi's Dandi March. In 1937, he was elected Premier of the Madras Presidency and later resigned in the aftermath of the Second World War. Notably, he stood in support of Britain's war effort, did not participate in the Quit India Movement and escaped arrest. He was thus able to devise a proposal to negotiate with the Muslim League which came to be known as the C.R. formula. He served as Minister of Supply, Education and Finance (in the Interim Government of India, 1946), Governor of West Bengal (1947-48), Governor General of India (21st June 1948-26" January 1950. He was the last Governor- General of India and the only Indian national ever to hold the office), Union Home Minister (1951-52) and as Chief Minister of Madras state (1952-54). In 1959, he resigned from the Indian National Congress and founded the Swatantra Party, which fought against the Congress in the subsequent elections. Rajagopalachari also played a key role in setting up a united anti-Congress front in Madras state under C. N. Annadurai, which swept the 1967 elections. Fig. 3.8 Chakravarti Rajagopal- acharl th  Dealing with Linguistic Diversit Linguistic identity functions as a strong socio-political force everywhere in the world, and so was the case in India. For the first 20 years after independence, the linguistic diversity of India emerged as the most divisive issue. The attitude India has adopted to deal with diversity in general is that of acceptance, tolerance and even celebration of diversity- whether linguistic or religious. Issue of National and Official Language The Constitution of India recognizes 22 major languages, including English and Sanskrit. The issue of national language was resolved when the constitution makers accepted not one but all major languages of India as India's national languages. However, the question of official language (for all-India communication and for which the chief contenders were Hindi, Hindustani and English) became highly politicised and was closely debated in the Constituent Assembly. Both Gandhi and Nehru supported Hindustani written in Devanagari or Urdu script. But the supporters of Hindi in Devanagari script gained strength once partition was announced as the votaries of Pakistan had claimed Urdu as the language of the Muslims and of Pakistan. In the end, the decision went in favor of Hindi against Hindustani by 78 to 77 votes in the Congress Legislative Party. Thus, the constitution provided that Hindi (being the language of the largest number, though not of the majority) in Devanagari script with international numerals would be India's official language even as use of English was to continue for official purposes until 1965, when it would be replaced by Hindi. The Parliament could also extend this period beyond 1965 for specified purposes. The decision regarding official language of the states was left to the state legislatures. In 1967, the government of India took another important decision on the language question and declared that Indian languages would ultimately become the medium of instruction at the university level, though the time frame for such a changeover was left upto the convenience of each university. Since 1967, the language problem has largely disappeared from the Indian political scene, demonstrating India's capability to deal with contentious issues in a democratic manner, promoting national consolidation. As for the future, both Hindi and English are likely to grow as link languages. English is not only the language of the world, but has also emerged as the second language of the Universities and the language of communication among the Indian intelligentsia. Simultaneously. Hindi has also been making rapid progress in non-Hindi speaking regions through the medium of schools, films, television, radio, tourism, etc. Issue of Reorganisation of States on Linguistic Basis Under the British, the provinces had been formed in a haphazard manner as and when they were conquered. After Independence, the need was felt for reorganisation of states and a strong case was presented for linguistic states. Firstly, language is closely associated to culture and customs of people. Secondly, it is the medium of communication, education, administration, judicial activities as well as politics. How could a language  play this role in a multilingual province? Cleary, it could not. For this reason, the Congress had reorganised its regional branches along linguistic lines since 1921 (After the Nagpur Congress of 1920, the Provincial Congress committees or PCCS were created by linguistic zones and thus, there was the Orissa PCC, the Maharashtra PCC, etc. which often did not follow the administrative divisions of British India) and had committed itself towards redrawing of state boundaries on linguistic basis. The linguistic reorganisation of the congress and the states was also encouraged by Mahatma Gandhi. However, Independence, coming immediately after the Second World War and that too along with Partition, created serious socio-economic and administrative challenges and changed the priorities of the national leadership. While still committed to linguistic reorganisation, the leaders felt that the most important task' was the preservation of national unity and other things could wait for some time. The country had already been divided on the basis of religion, would not reorganisation on the basis of language encourage further division? Would not multilingual and multi-cultural administrative units such as Madras (which included linguistic communities of Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu Kannada, Urdu and Konkani speakers) and Bombay (which included linguistic communities of Marathi, Gujarati, Gondi and Sindhi speakers) serve as examples of harmonious living and promote the idea of nationhood? Above all, should not the new nation focus on ideas of unity, secularism and economic development rather than revive primordial identities of caste and language? Nehru, Patel and even Gandhi were now convinced that linguistic reorganization should be deferred until a calmer time, when communal strife had died down, India as a whole had become stronger and firmly established and atmosphere was more conducive for such reorganization, In the words of Gandhi, the need of the hour was to take 'one step at a time'. Reorganisation of States: A Quick Timeline- • Linguistic Provinces Commission (headed by S.K. Dar, 1948)- It was appointed by the 'Constituent Assembly (under the direction of Patel, who was working hard to reverse the official Congress position) to enquire into the desirability of linguistic provinces. The Commission advised against the step on the grounds of potential threat to national unity as well as administrative inconvenience, But this could not satisfy public opinion and the demand was repeatedly voiced, especially in the South and led to the appointment of the JVP Committee. • JVP Committee (consisting of Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Pattabhi Sitaramayya, December 1948)- This Committee too advised against the step for the time being on the ground that national security and economic development were the need of the hour. Language was not only a binding force, but also a separating one', it argued. However, it also laid down that where the demand was persistent, a new linguistic state could be created. The Committee felt that a strong case existed for the demand of the new state of Andhra for the Telugu speaking people (Vishalandhra movement), yet the demand was not conceded immediately as Andhra was not willing to give up Madras city, which both geographically as well as linguistically belonged to Tamil Nadu. Though the JVP Committee report acted as cold water therapy and slowed things for a while, the years 1948-49 saw a renewal of movement aiming for linguistic autonomy and campaigns such as those demanding Samyukta (Greater) Maharashtra, Samyukta Karnataka and Mahagujarat soon arose. But the movement of Telugu speakers of the Andhra remained the most vigorous. • Fast unto death by Potti Sriramulu (1952)- On 19h October 1952 Potti Sriramulu, a veteran Gandhian, sat on a fast unto death demanding separate state of Andhra and died after 58 days of fasting. His death sent shock waves all over Andhra and threw the region in a fit of riots and rampage, forcing the government to immediately concede the demand for the formation of Andhra. • Formation of Andhra (1st October 1953)- The new state of Telugu-speaking Andhra formally came into existence on 1st October 1953 (inaugurated at Kurnool). Simultaneously, Tamil Nadu was formed as a Tamil-speaking state. The success of Andhra struggle encouraged other groups across the country forcing Nehru to appoint the next commission. States Reorganisation Commission (SRC, August 1953)- Nehru appointed the SRC with Justice Fazal Ali (jurist), K.M. Panikkar (historian) and Hridaynath Kunzru (social worker) as members to examine the entire question of reorganisation of states afresh. Notably, none of the members had any formal ties with the Congress. SRC submitted its report after two years (October 1955) and recommended the redrawing of state boundaries on linguistic basis. With respect to south, it recommended distribution of areas into four major language zones- Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. Thus, it sought to replace the mélange of territories of the British era into four compact states. Similarly, with respect to north, it recommended reorganisation of Hindi- speaking belt into four states- Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. However, the SRC rejected the demand for carving out tribal states out of Bihar and Assam. It advised against the creation of a Sikh state by splitting Punjab. It refused to allocate Madras to Andhra. It also advised against the splitting of Bombay and instead proposed the reorganisation of Marathi-speaking districts of the interior into a separate state of Vidarbha. Thus, Bombay state was to stay as it was, a bilingual province of Gujarati and Marathi speakers. • States Reorganisation Act (November 1956)- On the basis of SRC recommendations, the SRA was passed by the Parliament, providing for 14 states and six centrally administered territories, In this way, the formation of linguistic states did not disintegrate the country as feared earlier. On the contrary, it strengthened national unity and democracy.  Integration of Tribals Tribals are the ancient inhabitants of a region (hence called 'Adivasis'). The tribal population is spread all over the country, with significant concentration in the North East (where they are in a majority), Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. The tribals have lived in relative isolation, generally residing in deep forests or hills, practicing habits and traditions which are markedly different from the non-tribals. The colonial era had witnessed steady intrusion into the tribal areas and disruption of tribal way of life. The simmering tribal discontent had found expression in a series of tribal uprisings in the 19th and 20th century. After Independence, the govern- ment's approach was based on the nationalist policy towards tribals that had evolved since the 1920s when Gandhi began setting up ashrams in tribal areas and promoted constructive work. Neither isolation nor assimilation was considered desirable and Nehru adopted the policy of making the tribals an integral part of Indian nation, even while maintaining their distinct identity and culture. The two basic premise of Nehruvian approach towards tribal integration were- firstly, 'the tribal areas have to progress' and secondly, 'they have to progress in their own way'. To achieve the two seemingly contradictory goals, he also laid down some broad guidelines- • Respect for tribal culture, no imposition or compulsion from outside 'Preservation of tribal rights over their lands and forests • Encouragement to tribal languages • Administrators for tribal areas should be recruited from among the tribal ranks • Tribal areas should be administered through their own socio-cultural institutions In order to give shape to the tribal policy, safeguards were provided in the constitution itself. Article 46 directed the state to promote the educational and economic interests of the tribal people and protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation through special legislation. The constitution also extended full political rights to the tribal people. Along the lines of Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes were also provided reservation of seats in legislatures and in administrative services. However, despite constitutional safeguards and legislative action, the progress among tribals has remained slow and inadequate, particularly in view of poor implementation of even well-intentioned measures. Challenge #2- Establishing a Democratic Polity The establishment of the 385 member Constituent Assembly by the colonial rulers in 1946 marked the culmination of the struggle for democratic government in India. Though, after Partition the size of this body was reduced to 298 of which 208 paid allegiance to the Congress party, it is noteworthy that the Congress itself was an umbrella organisation accommodating diverse ideological strands. Thus, the Assembly comprised of members representing various shades of Indian opinion including   the Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs and gave direction to the establishment of democratic institutions in India, The Constituent Assembly functioned both as the Parliament as well as the Constitution Making Body until January 1950. Fig. 3.11 Nehru signing the Indian Constitution The Constitution of independent India came into force on 26h January 1950. Since then the day is celebrated as Republic Day. But prior to 1950, 26h January was known as Independence Day as 20 years ago in 1930, this day was celebrated as the First Independence Day or Purna Swaraj Day by the Indian masses. The Constitution of India, the highest law of the land, provided for a democratic and parliamentary form of government, with a socialist bias. At the same time, we must remember that a democratic constitution is necessary but not sufficient for establishing a democracy. A simultaneous challenge, thus, was to develop democratic practices in accordance with the Constitution. Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles The Fundamental Rights (FRs) and Directive Principles of state Policy (DPSPs), forming Part III and Part IV, constituted the conscience of the Constitution. The members of the Constituent Assembly were deeply influenced by the western values of democracy, human rights and political freedom. They declared the Fundamental Rights of the citizens of India as the most significant part of the constitution and made the individual (and not the family, village, caste or community) as the basic legal unit. This was a great step forward in the direction of justice and equality given the multiplicity of divisions in Indian society along the lines of religion, caste, class and language. Further, the Fundamental Rights were made enforceable by the system of courts with the Supreme Court standing at its apex. Independence of judiciary was ensured to defend the rights and property of citizens. The courts were also vested with absolute powers to interpret the constitution.   Page 22 Nehru Era (1947-1964) 59 Though not justifiable, the DPSPS were no less significant and constituted those socio-economic rights which the state could not immediately secure but which the state was directed to apply when making laws. Thus, they were really in the nature of guidelines issued to future legislations. Parliamentary System Over a period of time, the Indians had become familiar with the British system of governance. Naturally, when they were entrusted with the task of creating a formal institutional framework of state power in India, they opted for the Parliamentary system based on the Westminster model. Under this system, the executive i.e., the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Legislature. The decision making authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The President of India is merely a nominal head who acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. At the state level also, the real executive power is vested in the Chief Minister while the Governor is supposed to act on the aid and advice of the! Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister. However, the role of the governor has been quite controversial as he also acts as the nominee of the Center by virtue of his being appointed by him. Thus, there exists an inherent conflict in his roles which becomes far more prominent if the ruling in the state happens to be in opposition to the one at the Center. Electoral System The Electoral System introduced after Independence was the most significant advance, towards the democratisation of Indian polity. Under the new system, representative system of government based on universal adult franchise was introduced- a big leap forward for an upper caste and male dominated, elitist and largely illiterate society! The Election Commission was created (Article 324) to supervise the entire, procedure for national as well as state elections. First General Elections of Independent India (October 1951- March 1952) In 1952, India elected its first Lok Sabha since it became independent in August 1947. Until this point, the Constituent Assembly had served as the Interim Legislature. The Indian National Congress led by Jawaharlal Nehru won a landslide victory and Nehru now became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the country. In the first General Elections, India had about 173 million voters (85% of whom were illiterate) and the voter turnout was 45.7%. The Election Commission of India, a constitutional body, was set up on 25" January 1950. In March 1,950, Sukumar Sen was appointed as the first Chief Election Commissioner. In April 1950, the Representation of the People Act was passed by the Parliament. Parties Even as the General Elections were awaited, two former cabinet colleagues of Nehru resigned to form separate political parties. Thus, while S.P. Mookerjee formed the Jana Sangh, Ambedkar revived the Scheduled Castes Federation. The main political parties that participated in the Elections were-   • Bharatiya Jana Sangh (or Jana Sangh, founded by Syama Prasad Mookerjec, Delhi, October 1951)- The Jana Sangh was founded by 5.P. Mookerjee after consultation with M.S. Golwalkar of RSS (Rashtriya Śwayamsevak Sangh founded by Dr. K.B. Hedgewar in 1925 and consolidated by M.S. Golwalkar after 1940) as a party of India's largest. religious grouping i.e., the Hindus and based on the principle of: “Justice for all and appeasement of none". The Sangh suspected the Indian Muslims as a problem minority, which had 'not yet learnt to own this land and its culture and treat them as their first love'. It accused the Congress party of 'appeasing' the uncertainly patriotic Muslims. Dr. Mookerjee was vociferous in the cause of the integration of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of India and termed the arrangement under Article 370 as balkanisation of India. • Scheduled Castes Federation (revived by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, later renamed as Republican Party)- In his speeches, Ambedkar sharply attacked the Congress government for doing little for the upliftment of the lower castes. • Kisan Mazdoor Praja Parishad (KMPP, led by Acharya Kripalani)- In 1951, the respected Gandhian J.B. Kripalani left the INC to establish his own party i.e., Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party. As the name suggests, it stood for the interests of all toiling people like the peasants and workers. • Socialist Party (led by Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan)- In 1948, a group of brilliant Congress socialists had left the INC to form the Socialist Party. They were discontented with the Congress for its alleged lack of pro-poor agenda. • Communist Party of India- the CPI was also a part of the Congress since 1934 but later parted ways in 1945. All these various parties had only one target i.e., the ruling Congress. Undeterred, Nehru took on the challenge and declared 'an all out war against communalism'. In his speeches made during the election campaign, he pleaded to 'keep the windows of our mind' open and let in fresh breeze from all corners of the world'. He reminded the people about the government's determination to end untouchability, casteism and landlordism. Responding to his left-wing critics, whose end he shared but not the means, he ásserted that 'we can build the edifice of Socialism brick by brick only': Many doubts were raised on the success of these Elections variously described as 'the biggest experiment in democracy in human history 'or 'biggest gamble in history'. Universal suffrage in a land of illiterates was seen as 'crazy'. The new American Ambassador Chester Bowels had confessed that he was 'appalled at the prospect of a poll of 200 million eligible voters, most of who were illiterate villagers' and that he 'feared a fiasco'. There were times when even Nehru was in doubt. But once the election results were out, all doubts were at once put to rest. Bowels no longer believed that literacy was a test of intelligence or that poor countries needed a short spell of rule under a benevolent dictator as a preparatory   Page 24 Nehru Era (1947–1964) 61 step to democracy. Giving credit to the, Indian masses, the visiting Turkish journalist wrote, "176,000,000 Indians were left all alone with their.conscience in face of the polling box. It was direct and secret voting. They had their choice between theocracy, chauvinism, çommunal separatism and isolationism on the one side; secularism, national unity, stability, moderation and friendly intercourse with the rest of the world on the.other. They showed their maturity in choosing moderation and progress and disapproving of reaction and unrest'. Important facts related to First General Elections (1951-52): The Indian National Congress (INC)won a landslide victory, winning 364 of the 489 seats and 45% of the total votes.polled. Jawaharlal Nehru contested from Phulpur Lok Sabha Constituency, district Allahabad, UP. When Nehru died in office in 1964, he was holding this seat. The Second largest Party after INC was the CPI (won 16.seats) led by Shripad Amrit Dange (seat Bombay City North). • SCF candidate B.R. Ambedkar was defeated from the Bombay North Central (reserved seat) constituency.by little known Congress candidate Narayan Sadoba Kajrolkar. Afterwards, Ambedkar entered the Parliament as a Rajya Sabha member. • Acharya Kripalani also lost but his wife Sucheta Kripalani defeated the Congress candidate in Delhi. She later became India's first women Chief Minister, serving as the head of the UP government during 1963-67. : • G.V. Mavalankar became the Speaker of the First Lok Sabha. • Only Himachal Pradesh voted in 1951 (the very first votes were cast in the district of Chini) as the region experiences heavy snow in February- March, impeding free movement. The rest of India voted. in February- March 1952. No polls were held for Lok Sabha seats in Kashmir until 1967. The formation of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), precursor of the present day Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP): A Backgrounder Madan Mohan Malaviya (1861- 1946) and the Hindu Mahasabha (1915) Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya was an educationist, lawyer and a freedom fighter who also served twice as the President of the Indian National Congress. He was also one of the pioneers of scouting in India and started a scouting inspired organization called All India Seva Samiti (1913). He is most remembered. as the founder of Banaras Hindu University (BHU, at Varanási, in 1916, established through the BHU Act of 1915) Fig, 3.12 Madan Mohan Malaviya with Mahatma Gandhi  of which he was also the Vice-Chancellor (1919-1938). In 2014, Mahamana was posthumously conferred the Bharat Ratna. The 'Mahamana' title was conferred to him by Mahatma Gandhi. Born in Allahabad in a Brahmin family, 'Malaviya matriculated in the 1879 from the Muir Central College (now known as Allahabad University and started his career as a teacher in the Government High School in Allahabad. He started his political career in 1886, when he attended the 2nd Session of the Indian National Congress held at Calcutta. In 1887 he established Bharata Dharma Mahamandal to propagate Sanatan Dharma and Hindu culture. The offshoots of the Mahamandal were the Sanatan Dharma Sabhas, founded for the defence of Hinduism from critics both within the community and outside it. In 1911, up his flourishing legal practice to join the freedom movement and serve the nation full time. Malaviya emerged as a key figure in the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22) but at the same time he opposed the politics of appeasement and Congress participation in the Khilafat Movement. He appeared before the court one last time in 1924 when 177 nationalists were convicted to be hanged in the Chauri-Chaura case and got acquitted 156 of them. He participated in the Second Round table Conference in 1931, and issued a manifesto urging 'Buy Indian' movement in India in May 1932. Malaviya opposed the Communal Award (16th August 1932). which sought to provide separate electorates to minorities, left the Congress with Madhav Shrihari Aney in protest and founded the Congress Nationalist Party. Later, the Poona Pact (25th September 1932) was signed between Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Gandhi (along with others including Malaviya on behalf of the other Hindus). As per the Pact, Ambedkar accepted the principle of joint electorates in the condition that the' number of seats reserved for the depressed classes was increased from 71 in the Communal Award to 147. Malaviya became associated with various nationalist journals overtime. He became the editor of the Hindi daily 'Hindustan' in 1887 and of 'Indian Opinion' in 1889. He founded a highly influential English 'daily 'Leader' (Allahabad, 1909) with the help of Motilal Nehru and the Hindi paper 'Maryada' (1910). In 1924, Malaviya acquired Hindustan Times with the help of national leaders Lala Lajpat Rai and M.R. Jayakar and industrialist Ghanshyam Das Birla, saving it from an untimely demise and served as the chairman of Hindustan Times during 1924-46. He started the magazine 'Sanatana Dharma' from BHU in 1933. Pt. Malaviya condemned untouchability and emerged as a key leader of the Harijan movement. In 1933, he presided at a meeting in which the Harijan Sevak Sangh was founded. He worked for the eradication of various religious and caste barriers and made massive efforts for the entry of untouchables in Hindu temples. Another legacy of Panditji is the slogan ʼSatyamév Jayate' (Truth alone will triumph) given to the nation as president of the Delhi Congress Session in 1918 when he said that the slogan from the Mundakopanishad should be the slogan for he gave the nation. Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) was founded by Pandit Malaviya in 1915 as a right wing Hindu nationalist political party to safeguard  Hindu interests in the aftermath of the formation of All India Muslim League (1906) and introduction of separate electorates (1909). The first session of the All India Hindu Mahasabha was held during the Kumbh Mela at Haridwar (April 1915) under the presidentship of the Maharaj of Kasim Bazar. The conference was also attended by Gandhi; Lala Lajpat Rai was among the early leaders of the Mahasabha. It laid stress on Hindu solidarity and the need for social reform among the Hindus. Explaining the rationale of the Mahasabha, Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya stated that the Muslims and Christians have been proselytising in India for centuries, with the effect that the majority of Indian Muslims were converts from Hindu religion. Further, the Muslim League has been putting forward exaggerated claims for representation in elected bodies. To check these processes, he explained, it was necessary for Hindus to organise themselves. Thus, under Malaviya, the Mahasabha canmpaigned for Hindu political unity, for the education and economic development of Hindus as well as for the conversion of Muslims to Hinduism. Shuddhi and Sangathan became its objectives in the initial years. It also gave the slogan of Akhand Hindustan, against the League's demand for Pakistan. In 1925, the Mahasabha suffered a setback when its former member K.B. Hedgewar left to establish the RSS. In 1938, V.D. Savarkar, a former revolutionary, became the President of the Hindu Mahasabha and was re-elected again and again. In the subsequent period, both RSS and Savarkar propagated the Hindu nationalist ideology against the ideology of the composite Indian nationalism expounded by Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress. After the death of Savarkar, the Mahasabha was led by Dr. S.P. Mookerji. Hindu Mahasabha and V.D. Savarkar Under him, the Sabha developed a political program particularly opposed to secularism of the Congress. He was the first prominent exponent of the ideology of "Hindutva' or Hindu nationalism explained in his book Hindutva' (1924). In the process of developing his concept of Hindu nationalism, Savarkar rejected some of the arguments of territorial nationalism. Instead, he was a supporter of cultural nationalism. He argued that it was cultural, racial and religious unity that counted more in the formation of the nation. While defining nation, Savarkar wrote that nation meant a political community which had occupied a contiguous and adequate territory and developed independent national identity. He was of the opinion that Hindus constituted nation because they had developed close affinities with the lạnd bound by Himalayas to the Indian Ocean and the Indus River. Hindus considered India as their fatherland and holy land and thus constituted a nation. In this definition, Savarkar effectively excluded the Fig. 3.13 Vinayak Damodar Savarkar  those people who did not consider India as their holy land - because their sacred religious places were not situated in India. For him, Hindu nationalism stood for the unity of all Hindus. Hence, Savarkar popularized the concept of Hindu Rashtra maintaining that India comprised of one nation only-the Hindu nation and the Muslims must accept their position as a minority. The Hindu Mahasabha officially abstained from joining the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930 and boycotted the Quit India Movement of 1942 (Mahasabha was led by V.D. Savarkar during the QUit India Movement). Hindutva: A Brief Analysis.. The basic difference between Hinduism and Hindutva is that while Hinduism is a religion, Hindutva is a political ideology that aims at establishing a Hindu nation in India. The main arguments of the Hindutva supporters were as follows: • In the past, the Hindus suffered many a defeat and lost their independence to the foreign invaders because of lack of unity. • Aggressive proselytisation by the Christians and the Muslims had reduced the ranks of the Hindus who now faced a very real threat of being reduced to a minority in their own land of birth. Hence, in order to maintain the level of Hindu population, the Shuddhi and Samghatana movements should be launched. Shuddhi, stands for reconversion of Hindus. • There was a need to protect the political interests of Hindus as they had been historically discriminated against by the British. In an attempt to use Muslims counterweights as against the Hindus, the British had readily supported the political agenda of the Muslims while keeping the Hindus divided along caste and class lines. As a result, while the Muslims had aggressively pursued their separatist agenda, the Congress Fig. 3.14 Flag of Akhil Bharat Hindu (under the false notion of secularism) was betraying the cause of Hindus. In India, we could see the emergence of two traditions of Hindutva, one led by Mahasabha V.D. Savarkar and the other by M.S. Golwalkar, differing in their emphasis and methods. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar (1889-1940) and the RSS (1925) Hedgewar, also known as Doctorji, was the founding Sarsanghchalak or 'supreme leader' of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He founded the   RSS in Nagpur in September 1925. with the aim of promoting the concept of united India rooted in Hindu-nationalist ideology (the vision of Hindu- rashtra). Hedgewar was born in a Marathi Deshastha Brahmin family in Nagpur and went on to become a doctor with the help of B.S. Moonje (National President of the Hindu Malhasabha). During the 1920s, he actively participated in the activities of the Indian National Congress but soon got disillusioned with their politics. His ideas on nationalism were deeply influenced by the writings of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and V.D. Savarkar and he felt that the idea of Indian nationhood should be rooted in the culture and religious heritage of the Hindus. Hedgewar also started the tradition of keeping the RSS away from all anti-British activities. For instance, in 1930, he participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement in individual capacity and not as an RSS member. Fig. 3.15 Keshav Baliram Hedgewar The RSS is a right-wing, Hindu nationalist, paramilitary volunteer organization. It is widely regarded as the parent body of the Bharatiya Janata Party and has emerged as the world's largest missionary organisation. M.S. Golwalkar (1906-1973) He was the second Sarsanghchalak of Rashtriya Swayaimsevak Sangh. Born in a Marathi Karhade Brahmin.family (at Ramtek near Nagpur, Maharashtra), Golwalkar was the only surviving son of nine children. He studied in various schools across the country, his father being in a transferrable job (initially a clerk in Posts and Telegraph department who later became a teacher and a headmaster). In 1922, Golwalkar took admission in a missionary run Hislop College in Nagpur. It was the open advocacy of Christianity and disparagement of Hinduism here which is believed to be at the roots of much of Golwalkar's concern for the defence of Hinduism. Subsequently he left Hislop College, Fig. 3.16 M.S. Golwalkar completed his bigger studies in biology from Banaras Hindu University (or BHU, where he got influenced by Madan Mohan Malaviya- a nationalist leader and founder of the University) and began teaching at BHU. It was here that his students gave him the sobriquet of 'guruji' because of his ascetic looks. In 1931, RSS Sarsanghchalak K.B. Hedgewar visited the newly founded RSS Shakha at Banaras and was drawn to the ascetic Golwalkar, who soon joined the Sangh. During 1937-39, Hedgewar groomed Golwalkar for RSS leadership and tasked him with the management of the All-India Officers' Training Camp. His skills in leadership, reading, writing and public speaking were widely appreciated and in  1938 he was asked to translate G.D. Savarkar's Rashtra Mimansa from Marathi to Hindi and English. The resultant book, "We or Our Nationhood Defined' (1939) was published in Golwalkar's name and soon emerged as 'RSS Bible'. Golwalkar also authored the book Bunch of Thoughts' (1966). In 1940, after the death of Hedgewar and upon his behest, Golwalkar took upon the RSS leadership and over the next 30 years consolidated it as the strongest religious-political organisation in India. Overtime several organisations emerged which were founded and supported by the RSS and came to be collectively known as the Sangh Parivar. But the journey was not altogether obstacle free. As early as in 1943, several swayamsevaks defected owing to Golwalkar's stress on religion and relative disinterest in politics and formed the Hindu Rashtra Dal (1943) to carry out paramilitary struggle against the British rule. It is widely believed that Nathuranm Godse (Gandhi's assassin) was a leader of that group. Earlier in 1942, RSS did not participate in the Quit India Movement. Golwalkar has been accused of racism and extreme-right wing views ex- pressed in his book 'We or Our Nationhood Defined in which he described the Nazi campaign against Jews as 'a good lesson for us in Hindustan to learn and profit by'. He strongly opposed the idea of a secular Indian state saying- 'In this land, Hindus have been the owners, Parsis and Jews the guests, and Muslims and Christians the dacoits.' Historian Ramachandra Guha even went to the extent to call him the guru of hate'. Syama Prasad Mookerjee (1901-1953) and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (1951-1977) S.P. Mookerjee was an Indian nationalist, academician, lawyer and politician. He was born in a Bengali family in Calcutta' as the son of Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee (a distinguished jurist, mathematician and the second Indian Vice Chancellor of the University of Calcutta). After studying law in England, he embarked upon his political career in 1929 and entered the Bengal Legislative Council as a Congress candidate representing Calcutta University (Later in 1934, at the age of 33, he became the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University of Calcutta). However, he resigned the next year when the Congress decided Fig. 3.17 Syama Prasad to boycott the Councils. Subsequently, he contested the elections as an independent candidate and got elected the same year. In 1939, Mookerjee joined the Hindu Mahasablıa in Bengal, became its acting president the same year and soon got elected as the President of ABHM (1943- 46), In 1946 he got elected to the Constituent Assembly and served as the Minister of Industries and Supplies in the First Nehru Ministry. In 1948, he left the Hindu Mahasabha shortly after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. He resigned from the Cabinet in April 1950 following the Delhi Pact between Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan as he felt that provisions of the pact Mookerjee   would leave the Hindus of East Bengal'to the mercy of Pakistan. Subséquently, he founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (in Delhi, 21s October 1951) after consultation with MS Golwalkar of RSS and became its first President. Mookerjee strongly opposed Article 370, saw it as a threat to national unity and termed the arrangements under it as balkanisation of India. Since the state was allowed to have its own constitution, prime Minister and flag, Mookerjee gave the slogan "Nahi chalenge ek desh me do vidhan, do pradhan aur do nishan." Further, the Prime Minister's perimission was required to enter the state (known as Permit System). In 1953, he entered Kashmir without permission to protest against the system, leading to his arrest and subsequent death (June 1953) while in detention under mysterious circumstances. Later in 1977, the BJS merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party. After the Janata Party split in 1980, it was re-formed as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Federalism Decentralisation of decision making power is yet another significant feature of a democratic polity. However, in the wake of partition, the constitution makers made a strong case for a unitary system. Thus, in India what was established was a federal system with a strong Center. For this purpose, the Indian Civil Service was retained. Various other central services such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the Border Security Force (BSF) have also added to the centralised political structure in India. Further, the term 'Union of States' was preferred over 'Federation of States' as the federation was not a result of an agreement by States to join in a federation and no State had a right to secede from it. Thus, the federation was really a Union because it was indestructible. Secularism in India Secularism refers to that character of state and society where there is complete separation of politics, administration and public social life from religion. India's model of secularism: Dharma Nirpekshata Though both Nehru and Ambedkar were in favour of a legal institutional framework of secularism which could prohibit thẻ use of religion'in politics and administration of the nation, several forces compelled them to compromise on their model of radical secularism. Mahatma Gandhi himself was of the view that religion could not be separated from politics. The communalised atmosphere during freedom and partition of the country had further weakened the stand of the secularists. Therefore, the model of secularism that was adopted for free India was a compromise between the two extreme poles of orthodox Hindu communalism and radical secularism. Hence, what was adopted was the 'religious neutrality' (or Dharma Nirpekshata) model of secularism, implying distancing from direct religious propaganda and its use in politics and state policy.     Misuse of Religion as a Political Tool Religion was partially dissociated from state but could not be completely debarred from public and political life. This. ensured that the politics of India remained soaked in communal conflicts, the root cause of which was not invocation of religion for any religious gains but for merely political gains. Such a use of religion as a political tool has wreaked havoc on the nation building processes in India. However, it is true that the choice of 'Dharma Nirpekshata' was still a step forward towards true secularism. Freedom of Religion: A Fundamental Right Under the Indian Constitution, the right to freedom of religion and worship is a fundamental right of every citizen of India. The citizens of India are free to practice their own religion and the state guarantees religious non-discrimination in general and in public employment in particular- • Article 15 of the Constitution provides that, "the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any one of them". • Article 16 states that, "there shall be equality of opportunity to all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the state". • Article 25(1) guarantees, "the freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion...". All the same, it is noteworthy that the law in India does not prohibit the use of religion in politics, thereby perpetuating the use of religion as a political tool. Establishment of Democratic Institutions Building further on the traditions of national movement, the Indian leaders paid due attention to the establishment of democracy not only in spirit but also in terms of institutions and procedures. Even though Nehru and his party enjoyed overwhelming majority in the parliament, they extended full respect to parliamentary procedures, made it a point to sit through the Question Hour, attend parliamentary debates and make it a forum of expression of diverse opinions. The role of parliamentary committees was considered significant as watchdogs of government administration. The role of the opposition was also strengthened and Nehru responded positively to their criticism. The opposition too maintained the dignity of the parliament and kept the level of debates at a high level. Even within the Congress, Nehru promoted internal democracy, accommodation and decision by consensus. Federalism evolved in a healthy manner under Nehru who was coimitted to genuine devolution of power to the states. He took care not to interlere with state subjects and impose his decisions on the states even when it was for a cause close to his heart such as land reforms. The weaknesses on agriculture, health and education fronts are often attributed to their being state subjects. At the same time, Nehru was well aware of the need for a strong center to keep India united and firmly checked divisive forces. This process was further facilitated by inclusion of political stalwarts in central government and same party rule in center and states. Ground was laid for civil liberties to take deep roots- independence of press and courts was carefully nurtured even when they took a stand against the government.   The tradition of supremacy of civil administration, over the armed forces was also firmly established during this period. Size of the armed forces and defence expenditure was kept within limits and efforts were made to reinforce secular nature even after Pakistan began to receive large-scale military aid from the US in 1954. Establishment of Civil Administration Immediately after Independence, a decision had to be taken regarding the continuation of the administrative structure in the country, particularly its "steel frame- the Indian Civil Service (ICS). The ICS had been instituted by the colonial regime to serve the relatively simple interests of the occupying power, its functions broadly restricted to maintenance of law and order and collection of revenue. Nehru and Patel represented different viewpoints over the ICS question. Nehru was a staunch critic of the bureaucracy on the whole and particularly the ICS for its colonial roots. The ICS, according to him was 'neither Indian, nor civil nor a service' and considered it to be incapable of taking up the developmental responsibilities, of the new nation. However, Patel, the Home Minister, felt that the retention of the civil services was necessary in the troubled times when internal stability of the country was in danger and chaos. Finally, though the existing administrative machinery was retained, Nehru was acutely aware of the need to overhaul the services gradually to suit the changing needs of a democratic and developing nation. The ICS officer, of the British times had to be replaced by a person trained in service attitude rooted in ethics and empathy: Unfortunately, adequate steps could not be taken in the direction of reforming the administrative services and the ICS was retained under the changed name of IAS. Though praised occasionally for its positive role in troubled post-partition years, it increasingly fell prey to various bureau-pathologies including arrogance, inaccessibility, non-transparency, inefficiency and corruption. Challenge #3- Socio-Economic Development After Independence, many perspectives emerged regarding what should be India's development model. The Gandhians advocated gram swarajya with relatively self-sufficient village communities without an artificial proliferation of wants and modern mechanisation that displaced human labour. The socialists stood for growth with distributive justice and advocated land reforms, greater public ownership and strict regulation of the private sector as a means of achieving greater equality. The Swatantra Party (founded.by C. Rajagopalachari and M.R. Masani in 1959) considered land reforms as violation of fundamental right to property, huge public sector as incapable of efficient management and excessive state control an obstacle to private enterprise. The Congress, led by Jawaharlal Nehru, subsequently attempted a middle path, a sort of compromise between the above mentioned views and adopted a model of development leaning towards socialism. They argued that the leaders of the national movement had dreamt not'only of a democratic government but.also a government that would run for the good of all and not just a section of society. Thus, the. goal 1.   Page 33 70 Post Independence India before India was economic development with equality and justice. This matter could not be left in the hands of businessmen, industrialists and farmers alone but called for an active intervention from the state. In this regard, the Constitution of India was deliberately designed with a socialist tilt. The welfare goals to be achieved by the state were laid down in Part IV under the 'Directive Principles of State Policy'. The principles of equality and special protection to socially disadvantaged groups and religious and cultural communities were also laid down in the Constitution. The remaining challenge for the state now was to develop a design, or plan for development and accordingly evolve effective socio-economic policies. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. History of Planning in India The idea of economic planning in India can be traced back to the years of Great Agricultural Depression (1929-1933) when the government largely followed the policy of leaving economic matters in the hands of individual industrialists and traders. M. Visvesvaraya's 'Planned Economy for India' (1934) The first blue- print of planning came from M. Visvesvaraya, an engineer administrator. In 1934, he emerged as a pioneer in talking about economic planning in India and proposed a ten-year plan in his book 'Planned Economy for India' published the same year. National Planning Committee (headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, 1938) In 1938, the Indian National Congress appointed the National Planning Committee headed by J Nehru to prepare a plan for economic development of India. However, the functioning of the committee was impaired after the outbreak of World War II. Bombay Plan, People's Plan and Gandhian Plan (1944) Three plans surfaced in the year 1944: the Bombay Plan, the People's Plan and the Gandhian Plan. The Bombay Plan was prepared by Indian capitalists (leading industrialists and business men including J.R.D. Tata, G.D. Birla and Lala Shriram) and envisaged economic development under considerable amount of government intervention. An alternative to Bombay Plan was given by M.N. Roy in the form of People's Plan. This Plan envisaged a socialist organisation of society and prioritized agriculture and small-scale industry. The Gandhian Plan was authored by S.N. Agarwal in the light of Gandhian principles which again emphasised agriculture and small-scale production. It envisaged decentralization of economic structure with self-sufficient villages and cottage industries. However, all these plans remained plans only in paper and were never implemented. Nehru and Socialism Nehru's socialistic roots may be traced back to the year 1926-27 when he went to Europe mainly for medical treatment of his wife. Kamala, in Switzerland. During his year and a half long sojourn in Europe.   Page 34 Nehru Era (1947-1964) 71 Jawaharlal came in contact with political thinkers and socialist ideas. He got amply impressed by the Russian model of Socialism but at the same time he felt that there was too much regimentation in its organisation and denial of human rights to the citizens. Nehru wvas' also tied by a silken thread to the Right under 'Gandhi's influence. Thus, Nehru drew his inspiration from Democratic Socialism, a political philosophy that stands for political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production with an emphasis on decentralised planned economy: The term "democratic' is used to distinguish democratic socialists from Marxist- Leninist-inspired socialism which is viewed as being non-democratic in practice. Democratic' socialists opposed the Stalinist political system and Soviet economic model, rejecting the authoritarian form of governance and highly centralised command economy that took form in the Soviet Union in the early 20th century. To Nehru, planning was not only good economics but good politics as well. He hoped that the new projects would be like 'solvent to dissolve the schisms of caste and religion, community and region. Introducing the first plan to his chief ministers, Nehru had stated, "the more we think of this balanced picture of the whole of India and of its many-sided activities, which are so interrelated with one another, the less we are likely to go astray in the crooked paths of provincialism, communalism, casteism and all other disruptive and disintegrating tendencies." He also felt that development ought to be a cooperative effort and planning gave the people the 'sensation of partnership in a mighty enterprise. of being fellow travellers towards the next goal that they and we have set before us'. Clearly, from left to right, planning for development was the obvious choice for the country after Independence. Both the political leaders as well as the leading industrialists (who were generally weary of government control) were of the view that planned development was needed to put the Indian economy on track. Both also emphasised on the growth of agricultural incomes and outputs as a way for boosting industrialisation. The Bombay Plan explicitly saw state intervention and planning as essential for sustained industrialisation. By now, the idea of planning as a process of rebuilding economy had also gained currency all over the world. The inter-war reconstruction of Japan and Germany and most of the spectacular economic growth witnessed by Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s was attributed to planned development. Thus, the Planning Commission of India was set up with Prime Minister Nehru as Chairman in March 1950 by a simple resolution of the government. It had an advisory role and its recommendations became effective only once they were approved by the Union Cabinet. The Planning Commission opted for Five Year Plans (FYP). The plan was a simple document prepared by the government for all its incomes and expenditures for the next five years. It helped the state to set long term largest, prioritise its goals and spend accordingly. Four long term objectives of the Planners were-   1. To increase production to the maximum possible extent so as to achieve higher level of national and per capita income 2. To achieve full employment 3. To reduce inequalities of income and wealth 4. To set up a socialist society based on equality and justice and to ensure absence of exploitation. The objectives of Economic Planning were to be achieved through 'Mixed Economy' where Public and Private Sectors were to co-exist and some industries could even be jointly owned and managed. The draft of the First FYP generated a lot of excitement. Though the process and priorities of these plans were widely debated, the first three plans succeeded in laying the foundation for India's economic development. First Five Year Plan (1951-56) After Independence, India faced three main problems-rehabilitation of refugees, severe food shortage and inflation. Thus, the first plan accorded highest priority to agriculture including irrigation and power projects. Great irrigation projects such as Bhakra-Nangal, Hirakud and Damodar valley projects were started. Second Five Year Plan (1956-61) The Second Five-Year Plan accorded priority to rapid industrialisation with special emphasis on development of heavy and basic industries. Further, the Industrial policy Resolution of 1956 accepted the establishment of a socialist pattern of society as the goal of economic policy. Thus, the Plan also aimed as reduction of inequalities in income and wealth and more even distribution of economic power. Great Steel Plants were established at Rourkela in Orissa (by the Germans), Bhilai in Madhya Pradesh (by the Russians) and Durgapur in West Bengal (by the British). The Second Five Year Plan was the handiwork of Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, a polyglot and a Cambridge trained statistician who had brought modern statistics to India. As early as 1931. he had set up the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Calcutta and soon nurtured it into a world-class centre for research. As statistical advisor to the Union Cabinet, he helped establish the National Sample Survey (NSS, 1950) and the Central Statistical Organization (CSO, 1951). These were set up to collect reliable data on changing living standards in India and once again emerged as cutting-edge institutes of the developing world. In 1954, Nehru committed his party to the creation of a 'socialistic pattern of society' and the same year asked the ISI to prepare a study on the problem of unemployment. So impressed was Nehru with Mahalanobis' reply that he eventually tasked him with the responsibility of drafting the Second Five Year Plan itself. Recognising the enormity of the task, Mahalanobis travelled to USA and Europe, collecting information and doing his homework. In his draft plan, he finally outlined eight objectives, of which the first two read- 'to attain a rapid growth of the national economy by increasing the scope and importance of the public sector and in this way to advance to a socialistic pattern of economy' and *to develop basic heavy industries for the manufacture of producer goods to strengthen the foundation of economic independence'. Yet another objective was  the production of consumer goods not-only to safeguard the politico-economic independence of the new nation, but also to deal with the pressing problem of unemployment (in fact, the quickest way to create jobs was seen as the building of dams and factories). Clearly, the Mahalanobis model of planning laid great stress on the old nationalist model of 'swadeshi' or self-reliance which now emerged as the index of development or progress. Third Five Year Plan (1961-66) The aim was to basically continue the implementation of the First and Second Five-Year plans. The first two plans met with tremendous success. However, progress considerably slowed down in the last two years of the third plan owing to factors including Indo-Pak War (1965), two successive years of drought and increasing debt obligations to International Monetary Fund. Nehru had singled out two activities namely- the production of power and the production of steel as the 'essential bases' for planning (at the time of Independence, India had only two steel plants, both privately owned). Large dams came to occupy a rather special place in the economic development of India. Damming and taming of the rivers would kill three birds with one arrow- they would safeguard agriculture from the tyranny of the monsoon, and also provide the much needed power to run the new industries and prevent floods. In fact, dams came to represent 'the triumph of science, technology. foresight and centralized government over politics, petty local authorities and powers, ignorance, superstition, Enchanted, Nehru referred to the dams as the temples of modern India'. The most prestigious of these dams was the Bhakra-Nangal project on River Sutlej. At 680 feet, it was the second highest dam in the world, next only to Grand Coulee Dam on the Colorado River. It was built by all- Indian workforce, with the exception of Harvey Slocum, an American who had served as construction superintendent on the Grand Coulee dam. Slocum was a strict disciplinarian and had a distinct working style (for instance, all officers and workers were mandated and backwardness'. to wear the same uniform). Tired of the abiding sloth and inefficiency surrounding him, he once wrote to Nehru stating, only God, not Slocum, could build the Bhakra Dam on Fig. 3.18 Bhakra Dam, a concrete gravity dam built on River Sutlej in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh. Described as 'New Temple of Resurgent India' by Jawaharlal Nehru. schedule'.  National Development Council (NDC, 6th August 1952) The NDC or Rashtriya Vikas Parishad was formed in 1952 as an extra-constitutional and non-statutory body to serve as a platform for all the Chief Ministers to assemble, under the chairmanship of Nehru, and discuss all major issues relating to development. It was formed with the objective of securing cooperation of the states in the execution of the national plan and ensuring balanced and rapid development of all parts of the country. Today, the NDC remains the apex body for decisions and deliberations on development matters and considers the national plan as formulated by the NITI Aayog. NITI Aayog (1st January 2015), The NITI Aayog (Hindi for Policy Commission) or National Institution for Transforming India was formed by the NDA government in 2015.to replace the Planning Commission. It was established with the aim of achieving Sustainable Development Goals, enhancing cooperative federalism and formulating economic policy using a bottom-up approach as opposed to the top-down model followed by the Planning Commission. Development of Industry IPR 1948 (Industrial Policy Resolution) It was in the context of planned industrial development that the first IPR was passed by the Parliament of free India in 1948. Under the Government of India Act of 1935, industrial development was a provincial subject. The IPR 1948 brought about 20 industries under central purview. These included iron and steel, automobiles and transport vehicles, electoral machinery, heavy machinery, heavy chemicals, fertilisers, drugs and pharmaceuticals, cement. sugar and rubber manufacture, etc. The IPR also laid down certain goals for industrial policy which included prevention of concentration of economic power, prevention of growth of monopolies, balanced regional development, restriction on imports, generation of employment and maintaining price stability, etc. Some industries were reserved exclusively for the public sector (e.g. atomic energy and armaments) while others were open to private enterprise. For equitable industrial growth, the need for *cottage and small scale industries' was also recognised. The IPR 1948 was implemented through the industries (Development & Regulation) Act-of 1951. The most significant instrument that the government now acquired was the power to issue licenses (licensing system) for the setting up of medium and large scale industries. The Act also empowered the government to regulate location, technology, production, imports, sales, wages and salaries, etc. Mixed Economy and Self-reliant Industrial Economy It is clear that the aim of industrial policy in the immediate post-independence period was the establishment of a mixed economy. The public sector was to occupy a central role while adequate protection was offered to the private enterprise and foreign capital was kept under strict supervision. Under this protective umbrella, the development of a self-reliant industrial economy was envisaged through the process of import substitution.  Development of Basic and Capital Goods Sectors India was abundant in raw materials like metals and minerals and thus it was suggested that the country should first concentrate on 'basic' industries like steel, coal, heavy machinery, petroleum, cement, etc. which would lay the basis for rapid industrial development. Further, since the investment in this sector would yield low returns, it was also suggested that the public sector should take up this responsibility. Thus, with the support from countries like West Germany and Soviet Union, India laid the foundation for its basic and heavy industry. The Second FYP laid great stress on heavy industries. It was drafted by a team of planners under the leadership of P.C. Mahalanobis. The Congress had already passed an important resolution declaring 'socialist pattern of society' as its goal (at its Session held at Avadi near Madras) which clearly reflected in the Second plan. For instance, the government imposed substantial tariffs on imports to protect domestic industries. Assessment Though India has emerged as a major industrial nation, some of the objectives of the industrial policy have not been completely realised. The effectiveness of government intervention has also been a matter of much controversy. The Industrial Licensing Policy Committee (1969) observed that despite government regulation, certain business houses (e.g. the House of the Birlas) had acquired a bulk of the licenses issued and established monopolies. It was also found that Northern and Eastern India continued to remain industrially backward. The inability to bring about radical transformation of agrarian society and the resultant low growth of agricultural incomes has also put a demand restraint on the industry. Development of Agriculture (Land Reforms and Rural Development) In Indian planning, the bias towards industrial sector was somewhat tempered by a range of programmes directed at the agrarian sector. Indian Agriculture at Independence The British colonial rule had a devastating impact on Indian agriculture. It broke down the traditional agrarian system without replacing it with a modern scientific one. Commercialisation of agriculture and differentiation within the peasantry was brought about on an unprecedent- ed scale but it did not result in a shift towards modern capitalistic commodity production and the rise of capitalist farmers or of a developed labour market (the European businessmen found it profitable to squeeze the small peasant house- hold than to engage in direct production with hired labour, thus preventing the appearance of developed labour market). Thus, petty commodity production with traditional techniques remained the typical production pattern in colonial India. And on the morrow of Independence, what India inherited was an antiquated agrarian system yearning for drastic reforms.   MAJOR FEATURES OF COLONIAL AGRICULTURE The typical features that emerged in Indian agriculture under British rule and impoverished the peasantry may be enumerated as under Very high tax demand on agriculture Contrary to British claims, the land revenue appropriated under the British was generally much higher than that collected by the indigenous rulers. Further, tax demand was rigid and tax was collected even in times of crisis such as when crops were partially or fully destroyed. As a result, till the turn of the 20th century, land revenue contributed to more than half of the total revenue raised by the British' government. To make matters worse, harsh methods of revenue collection were deployed that included coercion, violence and abuse; with the effect that the land revenue policy of the British resulted in oppression, frequent evictions, indebtedness, land fragmentation, impoverishment and extreme misery for the agricultural classes. A direct result of the oppression of the peasantry was the stagnation and deterioration of agriculture and yield per hectare steadily declined. The colonial state also shunned responsibility and did not even put back a fraction of what it extracted; it hardly spent any amount on agricultural improvement, agricultural education or public works. Use of improved seeds and chemical fertilisers was low and only about 3% were iron ploughs. According to an estimate, nearly 60% of rural households, at independence, either owned no land or owned small, fragments of less than an acre. Growth of intermediaries and rack-renting The old zamindars were replaced by a new class of landlords, particularly under the land revenue settlements of Warren Hastings. Nearly all great zamindars of Bengal were ruined and replaced by merchants and moneyed classes who lived in towns (absentee landlordism), had no permanent interest in land and tried to extort as much revenue as possible during the period of their contract. In addition to the rent, the landlords also extorted numerous illegal exactions in cash, kind or labour (begar). Clearly such a system further accelerated the impoverishment of the peasantry. impoverishment of land and stagnation and deterioration of agriculture. At the time of independence, nearly 60-70% of total cultivable land in British India was owned by landlords. Extreme Indebtedness of the Peasantry This was the third major feature of colonial agriculture. The above factors left peasants with no option but to take loans from the local money lenders who charged them exorbitant interest rates. This made the cultivators heavily indebted and debt bondage became common in many parts of the country.  The most fundamental problem of Indian agriculture was that of inequitable distribution of land followed by problems of heavy taxation, absentee landlordism, rack renting, sub-infeudation, usury and low productivity. No, wonder, therefore, Indian agriculture that had been facing stagnation for a long time, had. begun to decline in the last decades of colonial rule. No wonder that, at independence, India was faced with an acute food shortage. During 1946-53, nearly 10,000 million were spent on importing food grains, severely affecting India's planned development effort. Clearly, the challenge before Independent India was to reverse the distortions and put Indian agriculture on a high-growth path. The need of the hour was- to redistribute land, remove various legal and illegal burdens on the peasant producers, abolish landlordism, introduce tenancy reforms, provide cheap credit, step up investment in agriculture and agricultural research, etc. In other words, the need was to bring about comprehensive institutional as well as technological reforms in land and agriculture. Hence, soon after Independence, the center and state governments launched a comprehensive programme of land reforms, largely inspired by the ideals and practice generated by the national movement. LAND REFORMS Definition: The United Nations defined Land Reforms as 'an integrated programme with the aim to remove the barriers for economic and social development that originate from deficiencies in land tenure'. Taking cue from this, the developing countries formulated their own land reform policies. Objectives: The chief objective of land reforms policy as laid down in the Five Year Plans was to eliminate all elements of exploitation and social injustice within the agrarian systems. This was expected to ensure equality of status and opportunity to all sections of the rural population. Measures: To achieve this objective, following measures were introduced as major components of the land reforms programme. • Elimination of the traditional economic-political exploitative power structure in the rural society • Redistribution of surplus agricultural land which would lead to more intensive utilisation of factors of production especially land and labour • Rapid adoption of innovative technologies and thereby increasing production and productivity, and • Strengthening of the motivation of the peasants for work and readiness to invest in agriculture.   Independent India's Programme of Land Reforms The programme of land reforms comprised of two broad phases- the phase of institutional reforms which began soon after independence and continued till the early 1960s; and the phase of technological reforms which began in the mid-1960s and gradually ushered in the Green Revolution. The two phases, however, cannot be rigidly compartmentalised. "Thus, the program of land reforms comprised of the, following components- Institutional Reforms (1947-early 1960s) 1. Abolition of Intermediaries (or Zamindari Abolition) 2. Tenancy Reforms 3. Land Ceilings and the Bhoodan Movement 4. Consolidation of Land Holdings 5. Cooperativization 6. Community Development Programme 7. Panchayati Raj Technological Reforms (mid-1960s) Institutional Reforms (1947-early 1960s) Abolition of Intermediaries (or Zamindari Abolition) By 1949, a number of provinces introduced zamindari abolition bills or land tenure legislation largely based on the report of Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition Committee chaired by G.B. Pant. Under this measure, the government abolished the category of intermediaries between the state and the actual cultivator (such as zamindars of British India and jagirdars of princely states who exercised control over land cultivated by ten- ants). The right of the cultivator over the land he tilled was restored and tenants were made directly responsible to pay revenue to the government. Further, the government also abolished the control of such intermediaries over common land of the village (including grassland, forests, ponds and lakes) and vested their control in the elected village panchayats. This was not merely a land reform but an equally significant social reform. A large number of village tenants, artisans, labourers, etc. were now liberated from the clutches of their exploiters. Politically, it also prepared the ground for the election of village panchayats on the basis of universal adult suffrage. The compensation paid to the zamindars in lieu of estate acquisition was generally small and varied from state to state depending upon factors such as political leadership and strength of the peasant movement. For instance, in Kashmir. no compensation was paid. Most states largely followed the UP model where the compensation paid was, notably, inversely related to the size of the estate acquired (to ensure that the measure was not directed against small zamindars who were hardly distinguishable from well-to-do peasants). Weaknesses in Zamindari Abolition However, efforts towards zamindari abolition suffered from several weaknesses. The landlords put up resistance at all levels including the legislature, executive and the judiciary. Several methods were used to resist the bringing in of zamindari abolition including parliamentary obstruction, litigation, corruption and even outright refusal to surrender land records. A significant number of landlords were generously compensated and were even allowed tenancy rights over land they traditionally cultivated as khudkasht (self-cultivated). As a result, many landlords resorted to large scale depletion of forest cover, fruit groves and grasslands as well as large scale eviction of tenants from their lands in order to declare them under khudkasht. This emerged as a major blot on the face of land reforms in India and the socio-economic inequalities in the villages could not be altogether eliminated. Despite these weaknesses, the process of zamindari abolition was largely completed within a decade of independence and. the typically. large 'feudal estates' were gone. In this way, while the main losers of zamindari abolition were the big- landlords, the main beneficiaries were the occupancy tenants (or upper tenants, who were generally rich or middle peasants) who had direct leases from the zamindars, and who now became landowners. Tenancy Reforms Clearly, despite zamindari abolition, the issue of tenancy in zamindari areas continued in the lands of the former zamindars who were able to retain lands by showing it under 'personal cultivation' as well as in the lands sub-leased by the upper tenants. Moreover, large parts of land (nearly 50%) were under ryotwari tenure where too the problems of landlordism and rack-renting the tenants were ram- pant. The second component of land reforms was therefore concerned with tenancy reforms. Tenancy reforms in India aimed at improving the lot of the tenant while maintaining a balance between the interests of the landowner (particularly the small landowner) and the tenant. The lot of the tenant was to be improved by providing for: 1) security of tenure, 2) reduction of rent to a 'fair' level and 3) securing tenant's right to acquire the ownership of land he tilled, subject to certain conditions. The balance between the interests of the two parties was to be brought about by a complex system of "floors' and 'ceilings'. Thus, while resuming land, the landowner could not deprive the tenant of all his land but had to leave with him at least the 'floor' limit prescribed (e.g. half the holdings or a minimum of 5 acres, whichever was less). Similarly, a ceiling was prescribed to the landowner's right of resumption. Weaknesses in Tenancy Reforms However, even the tenancy reforms suffered from several weaknesses. In order to deprive the potential beneficiaries, the process of large scale evictions of tenants began even before the tenancy legislations were passed, ant continued even after the tenants got legal protection. Surprising, in some states, only cash rent payers were treated as tenants while the sharecroppers (who paid a part of produce as rent) were not, resulting in their falling out of the tenancy reforms net and losing out on legal protection and tenancy rights. Finally, a major impediment in the implementation of tenancy reforms was that most tenancies were oral and informal, and not recorded, and therefore the tenants could not benefit from the legislation. The continued existence of a large number of unsecured tenants made the achievement of second objective i.e., reduction of rent to a 'fair' amount, almost impossible to achieve. The adverse land-man ratio that had developed in colonial  India led to inflated rents and even after tenancy legislation, it was only the upper tenantry (which had secured occupancy rights and was often indistinguishable from a landowner), which was able to enforce legal rent rates. Despite these limitations, it cannot be denied that tenancy reforms were a major step forward in independent India that did lead to a large number of tenants acquiring security and permanent tenancy rights. Under the influence of left forces and peasant movements, the states of Kerala and West Bengal gained exemplary success in this regard. Hence, we may conclude that the objectives of zamindari abolition and tenancy legislation were only partially met and these reforms saw only limited success in the country. Yet, it must be admitted that zamindari abolition enabled nearly 20 million cultivators (superior occupancy or upper tenants) to become landowners and led to many absentee zamindars actually turning to direct cultivation of the land. Further, tenancy reforms enabled quite a substantial number of tenants to acquire ownership rights and enforce legal rent rates. Thus, the cumulative impact of land reforms in the direction of creating progressive cultivators making investments and improving productivity was considerable. Operation Barga (July 1978, West Bengal) Guided by the vision of *land to the tiller', Operation Barga was launched in July 1978 by the Left Front government of West Bengal to register all sharecroppers (known as bargardars in West Bengal) so that the government could then secure for them their legal rights such as occupancy rights and a crop division of 1:3 between landowner and sharecropper. Land Ceilings and the Bhoodan Movement Another major component of the land reforms in India was the imposition of ceilings on land holdings with the objective of achieving a more equitable distribution of land. The legislation dealing with ceiling on land holding came into existence during the 1950s and varied vastly from state to state. Under this measure, the surplus land acquired was to be distributed among the weaker sections of society such as the rural poor, the landless, the scheduled castes, etc. However, these legislations could not be effectively implemented owing to weak social and political consensus. The landlords transferred surplus land on the name of their relatives and friends (known as benami' transfers) to avoid the ceiling laws, posing a major obstacle in agrarian reforms which is yet to be removed. Efforts towards introduction of land ceilings- A Brief Timeline In November 1947, the AICC appointed a committee headed by Jawaharlal Nehru to draw up the economic programme of the Congress. The committee had recommended that the maximum size of holdings should be fixed and surplus land should be acquired and vested with the village cooperatives.   Page 44 Nehru Era (1947-1964) 81 In July 1949, the Congress Agrarian Reforms Committee headed by J.C. Kumarappa had also recommended a ceiling on land holding. In 1951, the First Five Year Plan too adopted a stand in favor of the principle that there should be an upper limit to the amount of land that an individual may hold. However, the Plan anticipated that two to three years would be required even to set up the necessary machinery for enforcing ceiling legislation and thus envisaged no immediate programme of implementing ceilings. Clearly, despite early statements of intentions and recommendations, the actual progress on the question of land ceilings was rather slow in the first decade of Independence. In January 1959, the Nagpur Session of the INC was held and despite opposition from within and outside the party, the Nagpur Resolution was passed stating that that *to remove uncertainty regarding land reforms and give stability to the farmer, ceilings should be fixed on existing and future holdings and legislation to this effect... should be completed in all States by the end of 1959'. It further stated that the land declared surplus, was to be placed at the disposal of village panchayats and be managed through cooperatives consisting of landless labourers'. The Nagpur Resolution stirred up a hornet's nest and was faced with a wave of opposition both within and outside the Congress. Arguing that the resolution was the first step towards ending private property and compulsory cooperativization, and that a totalitarian-communist programme was being thrust upon the country, senior Congress leaders N.G. Ranga (Secretary of the congress parliamentary party) and C. Rajagopalachari resigned from the Congress and joined hands with Minoo Masani (leader of the Forum for Free Enterprises) to form the Swatantra Party in June 1959 with Ranga as President. Owing to lack of socio-political consensus, the states too showed no urgency to act upon the Nagpur Resolution and most of them later passed the ceilings legislation only by the end of 1961. Weaknesses in Land Ceiling Legislations Land Ceiling legislations in most states too suffered from several weaknesses. Lack of socio-political consensus not only caused long delays but also ensured that the laws were passed in a diluted form, mut- ing their impact. Firstly, ceilings were kept high (from 15 to 300 acres, depending upon the class of land and the range varied vastly from state to state). In a situation where nearly 70% of holdings in India were under 5 acres, such high ceilings could have hardly had any impact. Secondly, in most cases, ceilings were imposed on indi- vidual and not family enabling individuals to distribute their holdings 'nominally' in the names of relatives to avoid the ceiling. Thirdly, in many states the ceilings could be raised (by 60 to 140%) if the size of the family exceeded five. Fourthly, certain land categories could also be exempted from ceilings in order to encourage direct and progressive farming and included plantation farms, orchards and other specialized farms on which heavy investments had been made. True, this provision did result in at least some land owners indulge in direct and capitalist farming, it also led to large scale evictions of tenants. In certain cases, the exemptions were also carried to ab- surd limits- as many as 26 kinds of exemptions were allowed in Tamil Nadu. Finally,   Page 45 82 Post Independence India the long delays in introducing the legislation gave the landowners enough time to cither sell or make malafide transfers including benami transfers. Flashforward Owing to the weaknesses of land reform measures, not a single acre was declared surplus in large states like Bibar, Orissa and Rajasthan till 1970. In Andhra Pradeslh, merely 1,400 acres was declared surplus and no land was redistributed. Only in the case of Jammu and Kashmir were ceiling laws fully implemented- several thousand acres of surplus land was acquired (that too without payment of compensation) and redistributed among the landless. As a result, the year 1970 saw the emergence of a 'land grab' movement in many parts of the country under the guidance of the left parties. In fact, the politico-economic crisis of the mid-1960s (death of Jawaharlal Nehru, inflation, devaluation, Indo- Pak War, etc) coupled with the failure of land reform measures to match the legitimate expectations of the landless poor, gave rise to a strong wave of agrarian radicalism in several parts and led to the emergence of the Naxalite Political Movement in West Bengal in 1967 led by the CPI (Marxist-Leninist). In 1972, the Indira Gandhi government passed new national guidelines on ceiling legislation, lowering the ceiling limits. However, resistance to ceiling laws continued in a variety of ways including litigation and thousands of ceiling cases piled up in courts across the country. This forced the government to pass the 34th constitution amendment act 1974, getting most of the revised ceiling laws included in the 9th Schedule of the constitution so that they may have the protection under article 31B and their constitutionality could no longer be challenged. Thus, while it is true that nearly four million landless people did receive some land, the inequalities in Indian agriculture remained despite ceiling laws. True, over the long run, very large holdings of the semi-feudal type became a thing of the past on account of rapid subdivision of large holdings over several generations (by one estimate, by 1976-77, nearly 97% of the holdings were below 25 acres and 87% of the holdings were below 10 acres); yet, the problem of the landless, or the near landless, continued to persist. Bhoodan Movement (Acharya Vinoba Bhave, 1950s) The Bhoodan Move- ment (Land Gift Movement) was a voluntary land reform movement, started by emi- nent Gandhian Acharya Vinoba Bhave in early 1950s with the aim of persuading big landowners to voluntarily 'gift' a percentage of their land to the landless people. To achieve this uphill task, Bhave relied upon the Gandhian techniques of constructive work and trusteeship and organised an all-India federation of constructive workers (the Sarvodaya Samaj) which was to spearhead a non-violent social transformation in the country. The activists were to undertake padayatra, i.e., walk on foot, from vil- lage to village, persuading the large landowners to donate at least one-sixth of their land as Bhoodan or land gift for distribution among the landless and the land poor. Bhave received the first land donation on 18th April 1951 at Pochampalli village in the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh. The movement received open support   Page 46 Nohru Era (1947-1964) 83 of the Congress. A former Congressman and lender of the Praja Socialist Party, Jayaprakash Narayan, gave up active politics and joined the Bhoodan Movement full time in 1953. By March 1956, over 4 million acres of land had been received as donation. Afterwards, however, the movement lost momentum and has largely remained a missed opportunity. A major chunk of land received was either disputed or uncultivable and many donations were made as mere 'gestures'. After 1956, the movement took a new form, that of 'Gramdan' or donation of a village. The gramdan movement also drew upon the Gandhian notion that all land belonged to Gopal' or God. Thus, it declared that all land was owned collectively and equally and it did not belong to any one individual. The movement first started in Orissa and was most successful there. It has also been argued that. Vinoba Bhave picked mostly those viliages for gramdan where already little class differentiation existed, such as those inhabited by tribal communities. Nevertheless, by the 1960s, the Bhoodan/Gramdan movement petered out and its revolutionary and creative potential has largely been missed. Critics have also alleged that the movement was intended to 'serve as a brake on the. revolutionary struggle of the peasants.' Yet, the movement was significant in many ways. It was one of the few attempts after Independence to bring about land reform through a grass root mass movement and not through government legislation from the top. It also succeeded in creating a favorable atmosphere for political agitation in favor of redistribution of land, abolition of private ownership of land and for the development of agricultural cooperatives. Fig. 3.19 Vinoba Bhave and the Bhoodan Movement (1950s). Consolidation of Land Holdings Another defect ailing Indian agriculture has been the small size of land holdings (called land fragmentation) specially in view   Page 47 84 Post Independence India of population pressure on land (leading to adverse land-man ratio) as well as inheri- tance laws under which land could be divided equally among the sons on thc death of their father. As the size of land holdings increases, it makes it possible for cultivators to introduce modern technology for farming and increase their yield. Consequently, consolidation of land holdings was taken up in the First Five Year Plan itself. How- ever, pressure on land and our inheritance laws make it a continuous process and efforts in the direction of land consolidation continue even today. Cooperativisation Several'national leaders including Gandhi and Nehru were of the view that cooperatives (meaning farms or businesses owned and jointly run by its members, who share the profits) would lead to a major improvement in Indian agri- culture. However, as in the case of land ceiling, here too, there was a lack of general consensus including among peasants. Thouglh no force or compulsion was visualised in the beginning, the Kumarappa Committee recommendations (July 1949) showed the first signs of compulsion being used to prom.ote cooperatives recommended by the committee. As a result, the First Plan suggested that if majority of the owners and occupancy tenants in a village, owning at least half of the village land, wished to enter upon cooperative management of the village land, then their decision should be binding on the village as a whole. In the mid 1950s, exaggerated reports started pouring in about dramatic increases in agricultural output achieved by China through cooperative methods. Impressed, Nehru sent a delegation to China to study their model which further recommended a bold programme for extending cooperative farming in India. Nehru now mounted pressure on the states to increase agricultural production based on institutional changes such as cooperativisation. It also led to the famous Nagpur Resolution of January 1959 of the Congress which stated, 'the future agrarian pattern should be that of cooperative joint farming, in which land would be pooled for joint cultivation, the farmers continuing to retain their property rights, and getting a share of the net produce in proportion to their land. Further, those who actually work on the land, whether they own the land or not, will get a share in proportion to the work put in by them on the joint farm.' The resolution also stated that such an agrarian pattern should be achieved within three years. As stated earlier, the Nagpur Resolution met with a wave of opposition, both from within and outside the party. Senior Congress leaders argued that compulsory collectivisation on Chinese pattern was being thrust upon the country. The 1959 Chinese aggression amounted to further loss of face and prestige for Nehru, who now decided to adopt a conciliatory stand. The Congress under Nehru now declared that cooperative farms were to be setup voluntarily wherever conditions became mature. Weaknesses in Cooperative Movement In addition to the policy stalemate, the cooperative movement suffered from several other weaknesses as well. Firstly, many cooperatives were formed by big landowner families to evade ceiling legislation and access incentives offered by the state including subsidy, cheap credit and scarce agri- cultural inputs like improved seeds and chemical fertilizers. Thus, instead of benefit- ting the poor, the cooperative institutions were used by the dominant sections of the   Page 48 Nehru Era (1947-1964) 85 village to further consolidate their position. Secondly, many, state-sponsored cooper- ative farms were formed of previously uncultivated and poor quality land, and belied hopes of increase in agricultural productivity. Thirdly, these cooperatives became infested with all sorts of bureau-pathologies, including corruption and promotion of vested interests. Clearly, the poor and the landless got little out of the cooperative movement in its early years. Milk Cooperative: The Anand Ex- periment The Anand Experiment emerged as the most successful coopera- tive experiment in India. The marginal milk producers of Kaira or Kheda district of Gujarat felt cheated by the milk traders who bought milk at low prices but later supplied the same at higher price to the Bombay Milk Scheme. The Kheda farm- ers led by the Gandhian leader Tribhuvandas Patel then approached Sardar Pa- tel, the eminent national leader from the district, for help. Patel advised them to organise into a cooperative union and pressurise the Bombay government to buy milk from them directly. Subsequently, the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union Ltd. was formally registered in December 1946 and it began operating from Anand, Gujarat (Kheda and Anand districts together form the Charotar region of Gujarat). While T. Patel became its chairman, Dr. Verghese Kurien (a Syrian Christian from Kerala) served as the chief executive of the union (1950-1973). Henceforth, the union grew and diversified rapidly. In 1955, it chose the brand name of 'Amul' which soon emerged as a household name for a range of dairy products all over India (Amul comes from ʼAmulya' meaning priceless. It is also the abbreviation for 'Anand Milk Union Ltd). The Anand experiment paid rich dividends and considerably improved milk supply and the income of Kaira villagers, especially the landless and the poor farmers (the villagers, who queued up day after day to sell milk and collect payment, typically had one or two buffaloes and were mostly landless). In fact, the achievements of Anand cooperative went far beyond the obvious including benefits of improved income, nutrition, health, education, grass roots democracy, gender parity, gender empowerment and breakdown of caste barriers. Needless to say, the Anand cooperative has gone down in the annals of history as a major achievement of post-independent India. Amul The Taste of India Fig. 3.20 Amul Flashforward The success of Kaira Cooperative Union (Amul), also known as the 'Anand Pattern', made the spread of the milk cooperatives to the rest of the country quite inevitable. In 1965, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was founded at Anand to replicate the experiment and setup cooperative dairies on the Anand pattern all over the country. Subsequently, the NDDB   Page 49 86 Post Independence India launched 'Operation Flood' in 1970 for this purpose which transformed India from a milk-deficient nation to the world's largest producer of milk, spurring India's White Revolution. The Anand-type milk cooperatives ensured that the benefits reached the poor, irrespective of caste, religion anu gender, without targeting any of these specifically. In other words, they had the advantage of reaching out to certain deprived sections without targeting them separately. As the Anand Pattern gradually spread to other districts in Gujarat, the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, Anand, was founded in 1974 as an apex body of the unions to look after marketing. Later in 1979, an Institute of Rural Management (IRMA) was founded at Anand by Dr. Varghese Kurien for training professional managers for rural development projects, using the Amul complex as live laboratory. Thus, the spread of Anand Pattern was not limited to milk alone and cooperatives for fruits and vegetables producers, oilseeds cultivators, small scale salt makers and tree growers were ałso started at the initiative of NDDB. The 'Dhara' brand of vegetable oils is another outstanding effoit of Board. Verghese Kurien (1921-2012) Known as the 'Father of the White Revolution in India', he pioneered the Anand Pattern of dairy cooperative and gave the "billion-litre idea', Operation Food, making India self- sufficient in milk and milk products. He also made India self-sufficient in edible oils and is regarded as one of the greatest proponents of the cooperative movement in the world, emphasizing production by the masses over mass- production.

Fig. 3.23 Anand Pattern The Anand Pattern is essentially an economic organisational pattern to benefit small producers who join hands forming an integrated approach in order to economy of a large scale business. The whole operation is professionally managed so that the individual producers have the freedom to decide their own policies. The adoption of modern production and marketing techniques helps in providing those services that small producers individually can neither afford nor manage. It has succeeded largely because Anand Model involves people in their own development and because their interests are safe in their own hands. Under Operation Flood the entire institutional infrastructure set up at the village level, the district level and the state level is owned and operated by the farmers themselves. The Anand Model co-operatives have progressively eliminated middlemen, bringing the producers in direct contact with consumers. The Anand Pattern succeeded because it gave a fair price to the farmer and high - quality milk and milk products to the consumer. What would have been middlemen's profits in the earlier system got absorbed into development projects for primary producer or lower cost for the consumer. In short, the Anand Pattern meant the utilization of resources in the most profitable manner at grass-root level. Social impact The spread of the co-operative movement in the villages is contributing to social changes. Some of the changes are: • The democratic process - election of the village society's office-bearers - is breaking down social and economic divisions. The society is being perceived as a means of livelihood – unlike, say, a panchayat. The feeling, therefore, is that it ought to be managed by those who are likely to run it most efficiently – not necessarily by the entrenched elite.   Page 51 88 Post Independence India • Caste barriers are slowly brenking down in cqualizing queues before the milk collection centre. In the traditional socicties untouchables could not have even dreamt of selling milk for common consumption. This social barrier has been removed by the milk co-operatives. • Modern concepts like organization, technology, and social concern are entering the rural areas. In their search for solutions in other compartments of life, farmers often used the expression, "something like the dairy "or "similar to what the dairy does." • Education in a non-school sense is also spreading. Veterinary care, the supply of balanced cattle feed, and artificial insemination centers are contributing to health education, nutrition education and sex education. There is a change in the status of women. Generally income from milk is considered to be earned by them. Men concede that those women should have a say in how this money is to be spent. • Hope has kindled in landless labourers without employment that they do not have to migrate to cities in search of an income. Miłk co-operative societies have created white-collar jobs too. Amul continues to inspire one and all interested not only in dairying but also in other areas, people involved in the rural development and sustaining livelihood through massive employment generation. Need for Rural Development at the time of India's Independence At the time of Independence, India was predominantly an agrarian economy with roughly 85 per cent of the population residing in rural areas and deriving livelihood from agriculture and allied activities. Agriculture growth in the first half of the 20th Century was merely 0.3 per cent per annum. Illiteracy was as high as 84 per cent. Public health services were inadequate to face epidemics such as malaria, cholera and small pox. The mortality rate remained high at around 27 per 1000 in 1947. The railway system was built only for connecting the ports with production centres and import markets; all other infrastructural facilities were lacking. The state of agriculture, industry and trade was appalling and more than one-half of the population was below the poverty line. Early Measures The Community Development Programme and the Pan- chayati Raj were two of the earliest efforts in rural reconstruction launched in independent India. Though designed for agriculture development, they were load- ed with welfare content and laid the foundation for welfare state in the villages. Community Development Programme (CDP, 2nd October 1952) The Com- munity Development Programme (CDP) was the first major rural development programme launched after Independence. Based on the recommendations of the "Grow more food' enquiry report, Etawah Pilot project was launched in Etawah district of UP in 1948. Subsequently, CDP was inaugurated on national scale on 2nd October 1952 (Mahatma Gandhi's birthday) with the following main objectives:   Page 52 Nehru Era (1947-1964) 89 1. To secure total development of the material and the human resources in rural arcas; 2. To develop local leadership and self-governing institutions; 3. To raise the living standards of the rural people by means of rapid increase in food and agricultural produce; and 4. To ensure a change in the mind-set of people instilling in them a mission for higher standards. The CDP was conceived as an instrument to transform the socio-economic life of the village community as a whole cutting across caste, religious and economic differences and to provide an administrative framework through which the government might reach to the district, tehsil / taluka and village level. Initially, it covered 55 projects with a wide range of programmes for developing agriculture, animal husbandry, rural industries, education, housing, rural communication, etc. All the districts of the country were divided into Development Blocks (each block comprising of 100 villages with a population of 60-70 thousand) and a Block Development Officer (BDO) was made in charge of each block. Below the BDO were appointed the workers called Village Level Workers (VLW) who were responsible to keep in touch with 10-12 villages. In this way, a nationwide structure began to be created under the CDP. Thousands of BDOS and VLW's were trained for the job of carrying out an array of government programmes and make it possible to for the government to reach the villages. It was, however, soon realised that covering the entire country under CDP was not possible due to limitation of resources. Subsequently, the National Extension Service (NES, October 1953) was launched to expand coverage at less cost with greater people's participation. Thus, for the NES, government sponsorship was drastically reduced and self-help efforts were encouraged. The major contribution in financial and technical assistance came from the United States of America under a scheme of technical cooperation. Hence, the basic idea underlying both the CDP and NES programmes was the same. The two were integrated under one agency at the centre as well as in the states. Both had a uniform unit of operation called the Development Block. It was for first time an institutional framework separate from revenue administration was created for developmental activities. The main achievements of the CDP were as follows: • For the first time an organised administrative setup was established at the national, state, district, block and village levels. Its functions were 'developmental' and were totally different from the revenue collection functions of the previous administrative machinery. • Development was regarded as people-centric. A planned and inter-disciplinary approach to development was adopted. • Recognition was given to recruitment of trained personnel and the introduction of technical and technological inputs. • It introduced modern technologies in agriculture and demonstrated that they could perform better than traditional technology. • It led to the establishment of institutions such as agriculture credit societies, primary schools, hospitals and dispensaries, maternity and child welfare centres, etc.   Page 53 90 Post Independence India Despite the above achievement, it was observed that thcre was lack of enthusiasm, involvement and public participation in these programmes. The weaknesses of CDP have been enumerated as under: • The facilities created under the programme benefited mainly the rich farmers and could not bring any significant changes in the lives of marginal farmers and farm labourers. • Inadequate attention was paid to the development of responsive leadership, and hence the objective of self-reliance and people's participation could not be achieved. • The programme failed to bring about changes in people's ideas, attitude and outlook given the inadequate attention to social education. • Efforts to promote rural industries and cooperatives did not take off. • Other weaknesses of this programme included administrative weaknesses, bureaucratic red tape, problems of coordination, interdepartmental rivalries and absence of clear cut functional responsibilities at various levels. • The plan outlay for this programme was spread very thinly over a wide range of projects, as a result of which the impact of the programme was quite limited. Despite the above shortcomings, the CDP was instrumental in laying the foundation for the development of rural economy and defining rural development strategies and approaches. It recognised the need for investing in men/women and material as a means of bringing about social change in rural areas. Note- Soon CDP became an overburden and following food shortages in the Second Plan (1956-61), the approach of rural and community development took a new direction in the Third Plan (1961-66) with greater emphasis on agricultural production. This led to a technocratic phase of rural development leading to the introduction of the Intensive Agricultural Development Programme (IADP) and the Intensive Agricultural Area Programme (IAAP) and the high yielding variety programmes (mentioned ahead). Panchayati Raj (1959) To review the working of Community Development Programme and National Extension Scheme, the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee (named after its chairman) was constituted in 1957. The Committee believed that so long as we do not create representative and democratic institutions and endow them with adequate powers and finance, it is difficult to evoke local interest and initiative in the field of development. With this basic premise, the team made a large number of recommendations which formed the basis for the establishment of three-tier structure of Panchayati Raj in the country. Thus, the Panchayati Raj system came into exis- tence in 1959 with two basic objectives. These were (1) democratic decentralisation and (2) local participation in planned programmes. This was a big step forward in the process of development. The Committee felt that the district was too large and the village too small to be a unit of planning and development and instead favored the CDP' Block. It recommended establishment of statutory bodies called Panchayats Samitis for each block. Below the samiti, a directly elected Village Panchayat at the village   Page 54 Nehru Era (1947–1964) 91 and above the samiti, a Zila Parishad for each district was recommended. Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan were the first to establish Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIS) in the country and by 1959, all states had passed Panchayat Acts. The PRI's were thus seen as an instrument of socio-political change, leading to greater self-reliance, empowerment and grass- root democracy. Unfortunately, the working of the PRI's belied Nehru's expectations. The states showed little enthusiasm and bureaucracy showed little willingness to loosen its grip on rural administration. The PRI's became politicised and came to be dominated by rich peasants and capitalist farmers. In fact, a common weakness of the cooperatives, the CDP and the PRIS has been the ignorance of class division in rural society, where nearly 50% of the population was landless or had marginal holdings and was thus quite powerless. After all, development in a country does not percolate from top and it must be built around the development and welfare of the last man in India. Institutional Reforms: An Assessment With the aim of reversing the colonial agricultural structure that India had inherited, and inspired by the ideals of the national movement, wide ranging institutional reforms were introduced in independent India within a democratic framework and in the absence of use of force (unlike that in Russia or China where forced collectivisation had cost millions of lives). Despite weaknesses, the reforms succeeded on many fronts- large rapacious landlords were eliminated, many states scrapped land revenue, growing cooperative and institutional credit significantly relieved the peasantry froin the stranglehold of moneylenders, many formerly absentee landlords now took to direct and progressive cultivation, many former tenants and sharecroppers got ownership rights, a significant number of landless received ceiling surplus or Bhoodan lands. In brief, the cumulative effect of various institutional reform measures was considerable nationally; they laid the ground for the next phase, the technological reforms, that ushered in the Green Revolution. "In India's first twenty-one years of independence more has been done to foster change in agriculture and more change has actually taken pace than in the preceding two hundred years."- Daniel Thorner, an American economist and a keen observer of Indian agriculture since independence. Fig. 3.24 Panchayati Raj Technological Reforms: The beginning By the late 1950s, the benefits from land reforms and agricultural extension (i.e., increasing agricultural output by bringing more areas under cultivation) began to peak and a food crisis was in the offing. Thus, despite significant outlays for agriculture in the First Plan, the Second Plan period began to face severe food shortages. Nehru's focus now inevitably shifted further towards technological solutions. In 1958, he invited a team of   Page 55 92 Post Independence India agriculture experts from US Department of Agriculture and the Ford Foundation (that had already achieved certain scientific brenkthroughs in production of wheat in Mexico and rice in Philippines) to examine the causes of food grain shortages and suggest remedial measures. The team, in its report entitlcd "India's Food Problem and Steps to Meet It" of 1959, recommended that India should focus more on those areas where the potential of raising agricultural productivity was high. Once such areas of the country were selected, intensive effort for raising agricultural production specially wheat and rice in these regions should be made through the introduction of modern inputs like irrigation, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, credit and marketing facilities. Based on the above recommendations, the New Agricultural Strategy was introduced in the Third Plan (1961-66) itself. Under this, the traditional agricultural practices were gradually replaced by the modern ones, using modern technology. Some already developed regions were selected for intensive cultivation to grow more food grains. Two major programmes viz. Intensive Agriculture Area Programme (IAAP, 1961) and Intensive Agriculture District Programme (IADP, 1964) were launched. Both the programmes were based on the 'big push' theory of economic development, made large investments in irrigation, fertilizer, agricultural R&D, education, and extension services which subsequently led to achieve a period of high growth in productivity and production in Indian agriculture, popularly referred to as the Green Revolution or GR (mid-1960s to the end of 1970s, period of GR in India- discussed in detail in the next chapter). Sometimes it is held that the food crisis of the 1960s was due to prolonged neglect of Indian agriculture during the Nehru Years (1947-1964). However, this view is increasingly being abandoned. Nehru was well aware of the centrality of Indian agriculture and laid great stress on the development of physical and scientific infrastructure (including numerous irrigation and power projects, agricultural universities, research laboratories and steel plants) for the emergence of modern agriculture. The Plan outlays for agriculture were also substantial by any standard. Even the New Agriculture Strategy that subsequently led to the Green Revolution · was introduced in Nehru's lifetime itself. GREEN REVOLUTION-A BACKGROUNDER Green Revolution (or the Third Agricultural Revolution) refers to a period between 1950 and late 1960s when agriculture productivity in many countries, particularly in the developing world, increased drastically with the application of new advances including the use of high-yielding variety of seeds (HYVS), chemical fertilizers, pesticides, controlled water supply (usually involving irrigation) and new methods of cultivation involving mechanisation. The process of green revolution began with the commencement of agricultural research programme in early 1950s in Mexico by the Rockefeller Foundation team of agricultural experts, including Dr. Norman Borlaug who later emerged as the 'Father of the Green Revolution' and is credited with saving over a billion   Page 56 Nohru Era (1947-1964) 93 people from starvation. The term "Green Revolution' was first used by William S Gaud, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in a speech in 1968. Dr. Borlaug intensively researched on the Mexican wheat and succeeded in inventing high yielding varieties of dwarf wheat in mid-1950s. With the use of HYV seeds for wheat, Mexico wheat became self-sufficient in production by the early 1960s and even began to export wheat. In 1962, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was set up in Philippines (again with the support of Rockefeller and Ford Foundation) to develop new HYV seeds of rice crop. The new varieties of rice crop developed by the IRRI increased the rice productivity in Philippines even better than in case of wheat in Mexico. Like the Mexican Fig. 3.25 After the Second World War, increased deployment of technologies including pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers as well as new breeds of high yield crops greatly increased global food production. wheat, the rice seed varieties were also highly responsive to the use of chemical fertilizer and irrigation. These; two efforts were soon replicated in other parts of the world and played a key role in bringing about the Green Revolution in many developing countries, including India. Dr. Borlaug was given Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his contribution to agricultural development and solving the world's food problem at that time. Later, Dr. Norman Borlaug and Dr. M.S. Swaminathan (agricultural scientists) and C. Subramanian (Minister of Agriculture) emerged as the key persons in bringing the new agricultural technology to India. Development of Science and Technology The Indian leadership saw development in the field of S&T as a prerequisite to national development. Nehru himself had been fascinated by modern science since his Cambridge days. It was Nehru's firm belief that 'science was the spirit of the and dominating factor of the modern world' and that 'the scientific temper should inform all spheres of human activity, including politics'. At the time of Independence, a mere 0.1% of GNP was spent on scientific research. Under Nehru's active direction, the figure jumped to 0.5% within a decade and quickly exceeded 1%. age   Page 57 94 Post Independence India Early Developments in the Field of Science and Technology: A Quick Timeline • Research Laboratories (NPL, January 1947)- The foundation stone for India's first National Physical Laboratory (NPL) was laid in 1947. Afterwards, a network of 17 national laboratories specialising in different areas of research, were set up during the Nehruvian era. As chairman of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Nehru himself guided the funding of these national labs and other scientific institutions. These were guided by a strong utilitarian agenda and scientists here were encouraged to produce new products for the countrymen rather than publish papers in foreign journals. • Atomic Energy (AEC, August 1948)- India was early to recognise the importance of nuclear energy. A nuclear scientist whom Nehru patronised early and consistently was Dr. Homi Bhabha under whose chairmanship, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was set up under the erstwhile department of Scientific Research with the mandate to build and run India's nuclear power plants. In 1954, a separate Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was created under the direct charge of the Secretary. Bhabha, the Cambridge-educated physicist founded and directed two major scientific institutions, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR, Bombay, 1945) and the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay (AEET, Bombay, 1954, later renamed as BARC after Bhabha's death) which together emerged as the cornerstone of India's nuclear programme. rime Minister with Bhabha as The TIFR was founded by Bhabha with the support of J.R.D. Tata to carry our basic research in mathematics and the sciences (and later housed India's first mainframe computer). designated TIFR as the center for all large-scale projects in nuclear research. Subsequently in 1954, the AEET was established to consolidate all the research activity for nuclear technology. scientists and engineers were then transferred from TIFR to AEET, with TIFR retaining its original focus on fundamental research. In August 1956, India's first nuclear reactor in Trombay became critical. Though India's nuclear capability could have Flg. 3.26 Homi Jehangir Bhabha been easily used to develop nuclear weapons, the national leadership remained committed to peaceful use nuclear energy. In 1949, the CSIR All corresponding - (1909-1966), also known as the 'Father of Indian Nuclear Programme'.  • Institutes of Technology (1IT Kharagpur, 1952)- Many new engineering schools were set up including the flagship IITS. Patterned after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the first Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was set up at Kharagpur in West Bengal, followed by four others in Delhi, Madras, Bombay and Kanpur with the aim of providing technical personnel for the country and augmenting indigenous technical capability. • Scientific Policy Resolution (SPR, March 1958)- The SPR 1958 was guided by the Nehruvian conviction that 'it was science alone that could solve the problems of hunger and poverty, of insanitation and illiteracy, of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people.' • Space 1962)- India also promptly undertook space research and Nehru set up the Indian National Committee for Research (INCOSPAR, विकमअम्बालाल सारामाई 20 Space Research (INCOSPAR) in 1962 under Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. Once again Dr. Homi Bhabha was instrumental in setting up of the लभारत INDIA committee. The Committee took over the responsibilities of DAE (headed by Bhabha) in space science and research. It then set up its first Rocket Launching Facility at Thumba (Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station, TERLS). Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was among the initial team of rocket engineers forming the INCOSPAR which eventually grew into Fig. 3.27 Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai (1919-1971), also known as the 'Father of Indian Space Programme'. ISRO in 1969. Social Development Going beyond economic development, the national leaders envisioned wide ranging social change and development as well. A beginning was made in the constitution itself. Article 36 provided for Directive Principles of State Policy aimed at establishing a welfare state and just social order. The objective of 'socialistic pattern of society' was officially accepted by the Congress in its Avadi Session (1955) and was later incorporated in the Second and Third Plans. All economic reforms mentioned earlier including rapid industrialisation, land reforms and measures towards more equitable distribution of wealth also had a significant social impact. Education The leaders of young India were fully aware of the role of education as a key intervention in initiating and sustaining socio-economic progress. The need for education was felt all the more urgently in view of the abysmally low levels of literacy at the time of Independence (in 1951, only 16.6% of the total population 1919-1971 QA VIKRAMA SARABHAI  was literate, only 6% in rural areas). The constitution had already directed the state to provide free and compulsory to every child upto the age of 14 years by 1961. Subsequently, the Nehru years witnessed rapid expansion of education, especially in the case of girls. Hundreds and thousands of schools and colleges were opened and Nehru pushed for sustaining and increasing expenditure on education, even if the expenditure on industries had to be reduced. Despite these efforts, the growth of education could not keep pace with the needs of a rapidly increasing population. The 1961 target wvas first shifted to 1966 and then to a distant future. As a result, India continued to suffer from the evils of widespread illiteracy (as late as 1991, literacy was a mere 52%). Nehru was also concerned about the decline in the educational standards. Disadvantaged Classes The leaders of independent India took special measures to ensure the upliftment of socially disadvantaged sections of Indian society including the tribals, dalits, minorities and women. Abolition of untouchability had already been incorporated in the constitution and included among fundamental rights under Article 17 which laid down that "Untouchability is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of 'untouchability' shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law'. In order to fulfill the mandate of Article 17 of the Constitution, the Parliament enacted the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955, making the practice of untouchability punishable and cognisable offence. The government also took steps to implement constitutional provision for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) and other weaker sections in educational institutions and government employment. Despite all efforts, the tribals and lower castes continued to remain backward and oppressed. The fact that they formed a large part of the landless agricultural labour made it even more difficult to bring about a change in their social condition. Hardly any effort was made for the removal of caste system. Constitutional and legislative provisions in favor of positive discrimination based on caste have only belied the hopes, giving rise to caste-based politics and perpetuated caste ideology in India. Nehru was a firm believer in equality of women and often quoted that 'One could judge the degree of civilisation of a country by the social and political position of its women.' A revolutionary step in the direction of women emancipation was taken when Nehru moved the Hindu Code Bill in parliament in 1951. The Bill was aimed to complete the process of codification and reform of Hindu personal law in India, a process first started by the British Raj. The Bill stirred up immense controversy and subsequently broke down to four more specialised bills (known as the Hindu Code Bills) which came before the Lok Sabha in its 1952-57 term and included the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. Taken together, the acts raised the age of consent and marriage, introduced right of divorce to both men and women, gave women the right to maintenance and to inherit family property and outlawed polygamy. Clearly a major advance in the direction of women's liberation, it would take many years before the Acts could be put to full effect  HINDU CODE BILL; THE CONTROVERSY he Bill aroused strong opposition from Hindu nationalists who were I particularly exasperated that the Hindus had been unjustly singled out and the civil law reform concerned only Hindu community, whereas the Constitution enjoined (in Article 44 of the Directive Principles) the State to give the whole of India a uniform Civil Code. S.P. Mookerjce "government did not dare to touch the Muslim community." Nehru, on the other hand, was not willing to alarm the Muslim minority which was even otherwise under pressure and argued that such codification was necessary to unite the Hindu community first, which ideally would be the first step towards unifying the nation. However, it must be admitted that Nehru's secularism suffered here from a certain ambiguity, doubtless due to his concern to reassure the Muslims who had chosen to remain in India. He was prepared to condone the right of civil courts to apply Muslim personal law in cases affecting Muslims. In his view, the major- ity community had duties towards the minorities. 'He urged incessantly the im- portance of generous treatment of the minorities so that they would feel that they were Indians, and be completely at home.' Such an attitude could be denounced as an anti-Hindu bias while the RSS later described it as 'pseudo-secularism'. Despite all criticism, the passing of the bills were a solid testimony to his commitment to modernism, women's cause, to his ability to impose his views on others and to defy the Hindu traditionalists. Tent on to declare that the Development of India's Foreign Policy "What does independence consist of? It consists fundamentally and basically of foreign relations. That is the test of independence. All else is local autonomy. Once foreign relations go out of your hands into the charge of somebody else, to that extent and in that measure you are not independent." Jawaharlal Nehru The foreign policy of independent India was heavily based on the principles that had evolved during the freedom struggle. Indian leaders had naturally developed an attitude of opposition to colonialism and support to the various enslaved nations worldwide. During the Second World War, India had adopted a strong anti-fascist stand and the violence against Jews was severely condemned. Most remarkably, though India was itself engaged in a life and death struggle against imperialism and racism, its leaders took care never to take recourse to reverse racism and to avoid hatred towards the British at all times. Thus, Indian nationalism never crossed the line and largely succeeded in maintaining a safe distance from chauvinism or jingoism. Non Aligned Movement (NAM) In the aftermath of the WW2, a bipolar political world emerged and the world got divided into two powerful Blocks- one led by the communist Russia and the other by the capitalist USA. As both tried to increase their sphere of influence, a state of geo-political tension emerged known as the Cold War'. It is called 'cold' as the two blocks never directly indulged in full-scale armed conflict but heavily armed themselves in preparation for a possible all-out nuclear world war. Nehru and India's answer to the 'block politics' of the US and the Soviet Union was Non-Alignment. It meant taking independent decisions on international issues without being tied to any one country or a group of countries. Thus, India did not join either of the two camps and instead remain non-aligned. The term 'non-alignment' first gained currency in the post Bandung Conference (1955) period. It was the first large scale Afro-Asian conference that took place during April 18-24, 1955 in Bandung, Indonesia. It was attended by 29 nations, most of which had independent governments. The stated goals of the conference were to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or neo-colonialism by any nation. The conference was an important step toward the Non-Aligned Movement. The NAM took a concrete shape at the first conference of non-aligned countries held at Belgrade (1961). The five pioneering leaders of NAM were- President Tito (Yugoslavia), President Nasser (Egypt), President Nkrumah (Ghana), President Sukarno (Indonesia) and Prime Minister Nehru (India). The main focus of the movement was independence, peace, disarmament and economic development. When the charge of 'immoral neutrality' was hurled at India, Nehru stressed that non-alignment meant freedom to decide each issue on its merits. Hence, Non-Alignment emerged as Nehru's main contribution to India's foreign policy. Subsequently, Nehru and India's foreign policy has stood for non-alignment, peace and disarmament, friendship with every country and opposition to colonialism and apartheid. Nehru said, “We propose, as far as possible, to keep away from the power politics of groups World Wars...We are particularly interested in the emancipation of colonial and dependent countries and peoples and in the recognition in theory and practice of equal opportunities for all races...We seek no domination over others and we claim no privileged position over other peoples." igned against one another, which have led in the past two Relations with Pakistan The reasons for discord between India and Pakistan lay in the very manner in which Pakistan was created in August 1947. Nehru followed and liberal policy and tried to reduce tensions in Indo-Pak relations ensuring that all post-partition problems related to division of civil and military resources of undivided India were settled through negotiations. Unfortunately, Pakistan's response was not so positive. In an effort to establish its own independent identity, Pakistan has continuously competed with India in all fields and at all international forums, triggering an arms race resulting in wars. This has caused a serious strain on their scarce resources and severely disrupted the development process in both countries.   Kashmir: Issue Historical Context The state of Kashmir lay at the border of India and Pakistan and had a Hindu (Maharaja Hari Singh, a Dogra Rajput) ruling a mostly Muslim population. Hari Singh's bête noire was Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah, who had graduated from Aligarh Muslim University but failed to get a job in the state administration dominated by Hindus. Subsequently, Abdullah became a school teacher but continued to give voice to the grievances of the Muslims of Kashmir. In 1932, he played a key role in the formation of Kashmir's first political party the All-Jammu Kashmir Muslim Conference' which was renamed as 'National Conference' in 1938 on Abdullah's initiative to allow people from all communities to join the struggle against the autocratic government of the Maharaja. It was during this time that Abdullah forged close ties with Jawaharlal Nehru as both were committed to Hindu-Muslim unity and to socialism. Thus, while the National Conference increasingly grew pro-Congress, the Maharaja continued to nurture the dream of Independence. On 12th October 1947, the deputy prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir stated that- “Despite constant rumours, we have no intention of joining wither India or Pakistan...The only thing that will change our mind is if one side or the other decided to use force against us...The Maharaja has told me that his ambition is to make Kashmir the Switzerland of the East- a State that is completely neutral." Relations with Pakistan deteriorated over the Kashmir issue just two months after partition (i.e., on 22nd October 1947) when several thousand Pathan-tribesmen invaded Kashmir from the north and briskly made their way towards the capital city of Srinagar. Why they came and who was helping them? These two questions have · still not been satisfactorily answered and remain at the heart of the Kashmir dispute. While Indians mostly believed that the 'tribal invasion of Kashmir' was unofficially led by Pakistani army men, the Pakistanis disclaimed any involvement and insisted that it was a 'spontaneous' rushing of Pathan Muslims to the aid of their Muslim brothers being prosecuted by a Hindu King. Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir panicked and appealed to India for help (24th October). On the advice of Governor General Lord Mountbatten, Nehru informed the Maharaja that India could send its troops to Kashmir only after State's legal accession to India. Thus, the Maharaja signed the 'Instrument of Accession' (on 26ı October) and even agreed to install Sheikh Abdullah as the Prime Minister of the State. Pakistan, however, refused to acknowledge Kashmir's accession to India and intensified the tribal invasion. India then resorted to military action, supported by the local population led by Sheikh Abdullah, to drive out the invaders. By December 1947, Nehru was of the view that India must come to some 'rapid and more or less final decisions about Kashmir with the Pakistan government.' For continuing military operations would mean ʻgrave difficulties and suffering for the people of the State'. At this juncture, Nehru wrote a letter to Maharaja Hari Singh outlining various possible solutions to the Kashmir problem. The state could join  either India or Pakistan depending upon the result of a plebiscite. Or it could remain independent, its defence guaranteed jointly by India and Pakistan. Or Jammu could go to India and the rest of the state to Pakistan. A fourth option was that Jammu and the Valley could go to India while Poonch and beyond could be ceded to Pakistan. Unfortunately, this letter is much less known than it should be. It clearly testifies that Nehru was quite open to a variety of solutions with regard to Kashmir and the four options he had outlined in the letter continue to remain the four options being debated even today. EXCERPTS FROM NEHRU'S LETTER TO MAHARAJA HARI SINGH (DECEMBER 1947) "It is of the most vital importance that Kashmir should remain within the Indian Union...but however much we may want this, it cannot be done ultimately except through the goodwill of the mass of the population. Even if military forces held Kashmir for a while, a later consequence might be a strong reaction against this. Essentially, therefore, this is a problem of psychological approach to the mass of the people and of making them feel that they would be benefitted by being in the Indian Union. If the average Muslim feels that there is no safe or secure place in the Union, then obviously he will look elsewhere. Our basic policy must keep this in view, or else we fail." Around the same time, Mountbatten feared a full-scale war and advised Nehru to refer the Kashmir problem to the United Nations. Thus, even before the task of driving out the invaders could be accomplished, Nehru lodged a complaint with the Security Council of the UNO (on 30h December 1947). To Nehru's dismay, this move boomeranged against India at the Security Council where USA and Britain supported Pakistan's line of argument with the aim of propelling Pakistan as a frontline state against Russia. Consequently, the Kashmir problem was listed as 'India-Pakistan Dispute' at the UNSC, leading to a series of resolutions and culminating in a ceasefire between the two nations on 31$t December 1948. Ever since then, the LOC has emerged as the de-facto border and Pakistan has continued to control northern and western portions of Kashmir covering an area of nearly 84,000 sq km. In Pak-occupied Kashmir (or POK) as it is called, Pakistan has put in place a shadow government with capital at Muzzaffarabad. Over the years, POK has emerged as a hide-out for Islamic fundamentalists and terror groups to carry out anti-India activities. Further, a 1948 UN Resolution had talked about a plebiscite in Kashmir following two conditions i.e., withdrawal of Pakistani forces from the state of J&K and restoration of the authority of Srinagar administration over the whole state, Since Pakistan never accepted the two pre-conditions, a plebiscite could never be held. Critics have often blamed Nehru for his utopian standpoint and for being too much under the spell of Mountbatten when he rushed to the UN and made an open declaration in favor of a plebiscite on the Kashmir issue. The partisan posture of US and UK also contributed in further de-stabilising the region. In the post- Nehru era, the Kashmir Issue linally culminated in the first hot war between India and Pakistan in 1965 followed by wars in 1971 and in 1999 (Kargil War). As a result, Indo-Pak relations continue to remain hostile. The Kashmir problem continues to defy any solution and remains a military flash point between the two neighbours. "Kashmir may remain a 'Spanish Ulcer'. I have not found an Indian familiar with the Peninsular War's drain on Napoleon's manpower and treasure; and I sometimes feel that Ministers are loath to contemplate such a development in the case of Kashmir."- a British general had warned. Indus River Water Dispute Another problem created by the Partition was the issue of equitable sharing of the Indus River and its tributaries. With Partition, the headworks of some vital canals in Pakistan fell in India, creating tension between the two nations as India was blamed for any calamity like floods or droughts in Paki- stan. Subsequently, an interim agreement (April 1959) was signed between the two countries under the auspices of the World Bank which was subsequently followed by a comprehensive agreement. The Canal Waters Treaty was signed in September 1969 in Karachi. US Aid to Pakistan During the Cold War, while India remained non-aligned, Pakistan allied with the United States. It signed the Mutual Defence Assistance Agreement and also became a member of the SEATO (South East Asian Treaty Organization) in 1954. In 1959, a bilateral agreement was concluded between the two countries as per which Pakistan received massive economic and military aid from the US, thereby creating a security concern for India. Relations with China Nehru had a particular regard for the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek who had stood for India's Independence. After the Independence in 1947, China was one of the first countries with which free India established diplomatic relations (The famous historian K.M. Panikkar was appointed as India's first ambassador to China). In 1949, however, the government led by Chiang Kai-shek was overthrown and replaced by the new government led by the communist leader Mao Zedong (or, Mao Tse-tung) which India soon recognised in December 1949. Henceforth, India has consistently tried to establish cordial relations with the People's Republic of China, but the results have been frustrating particularly on account of China's aggression in Tibet (1950) and in India (1962) along with the persistent border stalemates. China's Aggression in Tibet (1950) China gave a jolt to India's hand of friendship in 1950 by occupying Tibet, much to India's bewilderment. Though India had inherited certain rights and obligations over Tibet from the British rulers, Nehru decided not to confront China on this issue and instead concluded the Panchsheel Agreement which formalised the occupation of Tibet and became the guiding principles of Indo-China relations. The five principles laid down by Panchsheel were- • Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty • Mutual non-aggression • Mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs • Equality and mutual benefit • Peaceful co-existence In 1959, following a popular uprising and suppression by China, the Dalai Lama fled from Tibet and sought political refuge from India. Indian government agreed to give refuge to the Dalai Lama but refused permission to set up a government- in-exile. China objected to the shelter given to the Dalai Lama and in retaliation occupied 12,000 square miles of Indian territory in Ladakh. The developments in Tibet prompted China to indulge in repeated border violations and extend Chinese claims on large parts of Indian territory. China's Aggression in India (India-China War 1962) In 1962, China launched a full-fledged attack on India and Chinese armies entered deep into Indian territory in Ladakh in the west and in Arunachal in the East. The war ended in a military debacle for India, leaving China in occupation of a large part of Ladakh territory. Doubts were raised on the efficacy of India's foreign policy and despite efforts to resolve all outstanding border disputes, the border stale mate has continued. More than 50 years have elapsed since 1962 but the long borders between India and China have still not been delineated. Nehru and Indian Foreign Service Nehru personally supervised the creation of Indian Foreign Service. Within five years of independence, India had as many as forty missions all over the globe. DEATH OF JAWAHARLAL NEHRU (27 MAY 1964) After 1962, Nehru's health steadily declined and he spent months recuperating in Kashmir. His sudden decline in health is often attributed AXARAXAPIIAI HEPY AEHIRr a 1889 1904 to the disappointment associated with the India-China War. On 27h May 1964, Nehru died of heart-attack, leaving no clear political heir to his leadership and, once again, a sort of political void was created. Two hours after Nehru's death, home minister Gulzarilal Nanda was sworn in as acting Prime Minister. Lal Bahadur Shastri was later sworn in as the 1989-1104TA CCPx15 Fig. 3.28 Jawaharlal Nehru on a 1989 USSR commemorative stamp Second Prime Minister of India.  EVALUATION OF JAWAHARLAL NEHRU Jawaharlal Nehru dominated the Congress and Indian politics since the 1930s and oversaw the transition of India from a colony to a republic. He was the first Prime Minister of independent India and remained in office for a long spell of 17 years (1947-64). During this period, he participated in three General Elections (1951, 1957 and 1962) and returned as democratically elected head of government each time. He remained committed to democracy and parliamentary system of government and must be given credit for nurturing the roots of democracy in India, specially so when democracy has not performed so well in other parts of the continent, particularly in the neighbourhood in countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Indonesia. Nehru also played a key role in the framing of the new Constitution, which has also stood the test of time and despite several amendments has not been abrogated even once. After the Constitution was enacted, Nehru embarked upon an ambitious programme of socio-economic and political reforms. He laid the foundation for planned development of India based on the principles of import substitution industrialisation and mixed economy. As a pioneer leader of Non-Aligned Movement and the Panchsheel, he played a predominant role in shaping independent India's foreign policy. However, it must be admitted that there have been instances of failure on several fronts. Nehru did not prove to be a good party organiser and had himself lamented on rising opportunism within the party. He heedlessly complicated the Kashmir issue and his utopian liberalism has often been criticised for deteriorating relations with both Pakistan and China. In sum, he left behind a troubled legacy of relations with both the neighbours. Notwithstanding the political troubles in his final years, he remained popular with the people of India and is fondly remembered as Chacha Nehru and as the architect of modern India. His commitment to nationalism, democratic socialism, republicanism and anti-imperialism continues to inspire the people of India even today.
