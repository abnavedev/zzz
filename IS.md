introduction
In a modern society, security is not military hardware, though it may include it. Security is not traditional military activity, though it may encompass it. Security is not a military force, though it may involve it.
Security is development – without development, there is no security.
A developing nation that does not in fact develop, simply cannot remain secure, for the intractable reason that its own citizenry cannot shed its human nature.
– Robert McNamara
The most important duty of the government is to serve the people and guarantee the security of the citizen and the nation. National security is about the free will of the government to take its own decision and to maintain the country’s sover- eignty and territorial integrity. The policies enacted by the government to ensure the survival of the state with the use of military, economic and diplomatic power in war and peace refer to internal security. Thus, it is an essential component in the overall security of the nation.
The State has been given the constitutional power and responsibility to protect the stability, harmony and security of its citizen. Thus, the State as an

organisation can justify to itself only by maintaining the peace, tranquility and internal security.
Managing internal security is a highly complicated and tedious process in a multi-faceted country like India because various factors like geography, history, governance, economic development, socio-economic inequalities and socio- cultural customs have their own influence in the security of the nation. Not only regional factors but also global factors play a major role in the internal security of the nation. The threat to internal security is widely caused by organised or indi- vidual violence from state or non-state actors, which are the violation of the law of the land.
Many aspects of the threat cannot be differentiated; still there exists some fundamental distinctions between external and internal threats and also between external and internal security.

Definition
(a)	Internal security is the process of maintaining peace within the boundaries of a sovereign state and other self-governing territories, usually done by maintaining national law. The liability to maintain internal security lies in the hands of the police, paramilitary forces and in exceptional cases with the military.
Broadly, internal security can be defines as one that deals with a security sit- uation that arises within the state boundary, therefore distinguishing itself from external security situations.
(b)	Every civil service aspirant must have an idea about the term ‘National Security’, which has a much wider meaning and scope. National Security is a concept where a government should make sure that the State and its citizens are protected against all kinds of crises through its political, diplomatic, economic and military might.
Thus, internal security is an obligation of the State to protect its boundaries. The State has a wider responsibility in the form of preventing various kinds of crime, to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens, to make sure of
 
 
the proper functioning of the democracy, to assure its citizen protection of life and property and finally to create an atmosphere of peace and harmony. The security forces play an important role in neutralising the threat to the country’s borders.


Attributes of internAl security
the various attributes of internal security are:
•	to safeguard the sovereignty of the nation,
•	to protect domestic peace and tranquility,
•	proper maintenance of law and order,
•	equality before law and equal protection of the law,
•	to ensure that people are free of any fear or oppression and
•	peaceful co-existence and communal harmony.

MAjor reAsons/cAuses/sources of internAl security DisturbAnce
There are many challenges to internal security. Some of them are as follows:
•	Lack of proper governance:
◊ a feeling of alienation in citizens and
◊ electoral reforms including intra-party democracy deficit.
•	Improper labour laws, deficit financing, ineffective economic growth benefits, development disparities, effect of subsidies, improper income distribution and ineffective monitoring of government expenditure.
•	Communal tensions, social injustice, societal divisions based on caste,
language and religion, ethnicity and narrow-minded vote bank politics.
•	Lack of effective technologies.
•	Use of armed forces of the union, viz. the army in counter-insurgency operations and in other internal security situations.
•	Poor and out-dated laws.
•	Lack of political will to enforce the laws to maintain stringent internal secu- rity policy.
•	Lack of effective policies to control media and other mass communication
institutions.
•	Disparities in socio-economic development.

non-trADitionAl internAl security chAllenges
In the globalised era, new dimensions give rise to various internal security challenges. They are:
•	epidemics and pandemics,
•	cyber security threats,
•	climate change challenges,
•	disaster risk reduction and management,
•	HIV/AIDS challenges,
•	small arms and light weapons proliferation and
•	environmental security threats.
Traditional global internal security challenges
Inter-state confrontation has reduced after the end of the cold war. Various exter- nal forces now oppose the intra-state conflicts as the current situation is ripe. For example, in the Syrian crisis, various countries have covertly supported either the regime or its opposition forces even when the internal situation in Syria did not escalate into war. One can also notice in conflicts in the middle-east region like Yemen that the world countries have never shown much interest in taking sides.
Thus, in the present-day context at the global level, internal security is threatened by the common sources, and it has to be dealt with by the states and with the help of other similar-minded nations to curb the menace.
The shifting of power towards Asia from the western nations caused the present century to be called an ‘Asian century’, and any vulnerability in this region would have had a high potential to change the course of history in the globalised environment. The devaluation of Chinese currency has made a sound impact on many economies similar to the 2008 financial crisis.
The foremost intra-regional threat now is terrorism. Different groups of terrorists have different demands but the motive is the same – that of causing damage to life and property of innocent citizens. Terrorism is now spread in almost every region of the continent. The serious evolving threat is that the fall- ing of nuclear warheads in the hands of terrorists due to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and any situation like that would lead to great loss.
The rise in militaries has never put countries into war, but the armed force is widely used to neutralise internal threats. Civil war-like situations across the world have increased the strength of armed forces, and are indeed used to pro- tect the ruling establishment.
Specially, instability in the Afghanistan–Pakistan region poses seri- ous threats to the whole world. It is the hub of terrorist organisations like the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda. Any activity in this region has far greater implica- tions. The withdrawal of USA’s forces from Afghanistan has produced a vac- uum, which has created instability in the region, and it also has the potential to divide Afghanistan. This has created numerous problems for India in the border regions with Pakistan. India with its inaccessible terrain and numerous terrorist camps and young terrorists pose as terror threats to weaken the northern border.
 
Being in the middle of the Golden Crescent and the Golden Triangle, India faces threats from drug traffickers and gun runners who use the instability in the region to establish an anarchical state.
Recent conflicts in Libya, Syria, Yemen, etc. were not prevented by the United Nations or any other multilateral organisations, and it appears that these organisa- tions are powerless in times of such conflicts. India’s request for reform in such multilateral bodies has to be given due consideration because only a powerful mul- tilateral body can prevent such conflicts from growing into a prolonged civil war.
Maritime security needs to be given a lot of importance from maritime nations as nearly 95 per cent of trade is through the sea and 95 per cent of Internet traffic is via undersea cables. Thus, the safety of Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC) should be given due consideration, and trade must be carried out with- out any threat. Mercantile Navy is threatened by sea pirates around the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia, and various nations have joined their hands in protecting the sea from the threat of pirates. India, a subcontinent, with a coast line of 7,600 km has had a bitter experience of terrorists arriving from the sea. For example, the 26/11 Mumbai attack, which was carried out by terrorists who hijacked a boat from Karachi, is the best example of maritime terrorism. Thus, maritime security includes terrorist’s threats, smuggling of narcotics, gun running and trafficking, which also pose serious internal security challenges to India.
Conflicts in west Asia have reduced the investments in new technologies to efficiently produce hydrocarbons, and this reduction in hydrocarbon reserves and conflicts in the regions of high hydrocarbons reserves has increased con- cerns over energy security. Thus, we are left to face the situation of reduced out- put of hydrocarbon. If energy is not secured, the world may have to face a war of oil once again. India being a developing nation requires enormous amounts of oil for its sustenance. A number of reasons have been a hindrance in exploiting its energy reserves internally. India’s energy security has been derailed by externally induced internal threats.
Non-traditional global internal security challenges
In recent years many newer challenges apart from traditional security challenges have far wider implications. Climate change is one among them, which is caused by global warming. Global warming leads to the melting of glaciers, which in turn raises the sea level and submerges island nations and low-lying coastal areas. Moreover, climate change also has its impact in agriculture by changes in the rain- fall pattern and reducing its output and can also cause huge water stress. Thus, the world is faced with increased risk of a water war. Highly rainfall-dependent countries like India have to be prudent against the looming climate change and its consequences.
The recent case of the Ebola virus is a good example of how the world is interconnected, a disease affecting a remote African nation led to a huge global scare. Another example is the SARS virus in south Asia, which caused such a stir some years ago. Communicable diseases emanating anywhere have such potential
 
to turn out to be a global pandemic. Every nation has to protect itself from these threats. In India’s case, our country has to be highly vigilant, owing to its huge and dense population and poor sanitary practices, as any such pandemic disease can become uncontrollable. A nation that is developed has to provide healthy long life to its citizens and protect them from such pandemics.
The interconnected world has paved the way for everyone to be connected via the Internet. Information and communication technology has transformed the whole world. It has provided various advantages that have made life easy, but it also has numerous disadvantages, the most prominent cyber threat hav- ing manifold negative implications. Cyber threat is a malware infecting individual computers to disrupt its services and may lead to cyber war. Such attack has the potential to threaten the whole nation. Thus, cyber security threat is the emerg- ing internal security challenge. Apart from physical military confrontations, cyber confrontations have increased. India had faced and has been facing a number of cyber attacks from across the borders. Thus, the government has to provide nec- essary protection to its data and its citizens from such attacks.

india’s internal security challenges
Some of the internal security challenges with respect to India are as follows:



 
 
unstable neighborhood
Unstable neighborhood has made India vulnerable to security threats. Pakistan is waging a covert or secret war against India when it is fighting terrorists overtly in its own tribal provinces. Nepal has emerged from years of insurgency of Maoist fighters; it has recently agreed to sign a constitution based on federalism. Bangladesh, itself facing threats from fundamentalist forces, has cracked down on militants but still serves as a hiding place for insurgents. Insurgents from the northeastern part of India use Myanmar as their base. Though Myanmar has opened up to democracy, it has to get stronger in administration to prevent regional and ethnic tensions in its provinces and also other anti-national ele- ments. Thus, even if stability is maintained internally in India, it can easily be disturbed by various elements acting from foreign soil.

insurgency in the northeast
Since independence, the northeastern region has suffered from a number of secessionist, and extremist insurgent activities. All seven states in the northeast is a party to some kind of movement, but its motive and demands differ. Though the constitutional provision for creating autonomous tribal regions has been made with greater power, it has not been realised. The Nationalist Social Council of Nagaland (NSCN) is one among the well-known insurgent organizations, which runs a government in exile from Myanmar.

threat of communalism
Communalism has created a disorder in India, right from the British days of ‘divide and rule’ to the days of partition. The seed of hatred had been well estab- lished in the Indian psyche. Communal forces are whipped up by bad elements that seek to achieve their economical and political motives. Communal clashes have created disillusionment among various minority religions. The government is working hard to take a neutral stand in the atmosphere where the balance is one sided.

caste conflicts
Mutual hatred between castes has paved the way for violence, and to the new age honour killings. Caste panchayats have taken people towards the medieval era. Caste violence, regionalism and ethnicity have displaced thousands of people and have created tension. A good example is the huge exodus of northeast people from the south. The result of Telangana movement was positive; it has still divided people who speak the same language based on territory. Such kind of regional and ethnic problems continue making it a tough task for the government to deal with such situations. The police force in the states devote their far share of time and resources to present and to deal with caste clashes.
 
regional and ethnic conflicts in Various Parts of the country
The ethnic conflicts across different regions of the country have raised a number of internal security issues. Ethnic conflicts in northeastern states and the son- of-the-soil theory in Maharashtra are a few examples. The conflicts sometimes require the use of a larger force to bring the situation under control.

left Wing extremist Movement
The Naxal Movement or the Left Wing Extremism has been the source of extreme violence in some parts of the country. These extremists are internally waging wars against the state. It is considered to be the most important inter- nal security concern. These extremist movements have disconnected several tribal villages from the national main stream. Maoism requires abolition of the State to establish the rule of people. The extremists attack the symbols of the country’s power such as the police, schools and other government institutions. Multi-pronged strategies have been developed by the government to contain this movement.

situation in jammu and Kashmir
Jammu and Kashmir militancy is perennial; it poses grave internal security prob- lems. This problem, which has been in the scene since the partition of the coun- try, has the character of communal tension, secessionist tendency, anti-state violence and intervention by an external state. Since then, Pakistan has tried various ways to overtly and covertly wane away the state, and one such way is militancy. Youths of Kashmir are indoctrinated, trained in Pakistan and aggra- vated to wage war against India. The militancy has now been reduced as fruits of development reach the people. Developments in Jammu are also felt across the rest of the country, making it one of the most significant internal security issues in India.

trans-border Migration from bangladesh
The burning issue in the northeastern part of India is the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh especially in Assam, West Bengal and adjoining areas, which have serious socio-political implications. This issue as mandated by the government is to be dealt by the Border Security Force (BSF), and the Foreigner Tribunal issue but makes seasonal appearances during the general elections time.
Illegal migration usually occurs through the porous land borders; the migrants can swim along the river to reach India. Some of these migrants are involved in anti-national activities like terrorism, arms trade, money laundering, fake currency rackets, which pose a severe challenge to the internal security. Most of them settle down as Indians in most parts of the country making unhealthy demographic changes across the country.
 
Misuse of it tools
The introduction of information and communication technology has led to a new vista in lifestyle and it also throws many security challenges. The computer that has been used to commit a crime, or a target may be, it is cyber crime either way.
Misuse of information technology tools refers more precisely to criminal exploitation of the Internet. Cyber crime has become high profile, particularly hacking, copyright infringement, identity theft, child pornography and child grooming. Confidential information is lost or stolen, otherwise leading to the problem of privacy.
Globally, both governments and non-state actors grow in importance, with the ability to engage in cross-border attacks referred to as cyber warfare. Strategic establishments have become the target of attack by misguided youths in hostile countries because of which cyber security systems will have to be strengthened.

china’s interest in the northeast
China’s official map itself contains Arunachal Pradesh as an extended territory of southern Tibet. To have its presence and control over the northeastern part of India, China uses all its devices. Some sections of northeast people also support China’s efforts as they have similarities with the Chinese racially and culturally.

fActors resPonsible for internAl security ProbleMs
The factors that are responsible for internal security problems in India are:
•	large-scale poverty and unemployment,
•	lack of proper governance in many regions,
•	increased communal violence,
•	regional elites using religion, language, region, caste, etc. to their advantage,
•	jobless growth,
•	unstable neighbourhood,
•	open borders, which are difficult to monitor,
•	corruption,
•	prolonged judicial process and
•	caste consciousness.
Some of these factors have their base in history and the others are contemporary. Some of the factors are elaborated here.

Poverty and unemployment
It is a present-day factor responsible for rise in internal security threats. This  is the fundamental reason for the origin of Maoism in India. Our country can
 
 
prevent the youth from being brainwashed by these forces if these two prob- lems can be reduced. It is the responsibility of the government to address these chronic problems.

governance Deficit
The lack of governance is a prominent factor that creates internal disturbances. People take up extremist paths to protest in opposition to the government. The steps taken by the government should be proactive and should involve the peo- ple and work assiduously to improve their socio-economic condition.

communal tension
The other factor that is on the rise that causes internal disturbances is commu- nal tension. People support political parties on the basis of religion, which gives power in the hands of such people, who tend to misuse it.
Gentle politicians are now an uncommon breed. Some people use divisive politics based on language, religion, caste, region, etc. for their gains. This has far- reaching effects and can cause death and destruction.

unequal growth
Growth has reached only a small set of people, while the remaining are still reel- ing under poverty. Thus, the effects of positive growth are not equally distributed and have been a cause for simmering tension to the downtrodden people.

unstable neighborhood
Instability in the neighbourhood has been cause for the continuing threat. While Pakistan has been a major player in the prolonging tension in the Kashmir region, countries such as Bangladesh and Myanmar serve as a base for anti-national activ- ities. Open borders with thick forest cover are difficult to be monitored, which serves as a hideout for the militants and to evade capture and prosecution easily.

corruption
Corruption is one of the reasons why people fight with government organisa- tions. People see the whole state to be corrupt. To restore order in the society, people strive to overthrow the state and this attracts people to Maoists.

Prolonged judicial Processes
In India the judicial process takes a long time and people get delayed justice or are even denied justice; this leads to the proliferation of kangaroo courts. People are disillusioned with time-consuming judicial process, and they start questioning the fairness of the system and the rule of the law.
 
caste consciousness
Even in the globalised environment, caste consciousness has not gone astray. Some section of the people still have a medieval mindset. Recently, there were various pronouncements regarding the fair treatment of women. Honour kill- ings as a part of caste assertions turn ugly. Many Dalit villages in southern states have burnt in caste conflicts. Untouchability, a sin, is still not eliminated and thus serves as a demonstration of caste in our society.

inDiA’s Defence AnD security Policy
The Defence and Security Policy is a process by which a country deals with any threatening situation. Conventionally, the policy dealt only with external threats originating from an unfriendly state, but now in the current scenario the defence policy also includes internal threat situations. In his book Defending India, Jaswant Singh, Former Defence Minister notes that “principle challenges to India histori- cally been and remains the imposition and maintenance of public order”.
India’s security interests arise from its historical and geographical factors and its political and economic relations with other nations, its resource depen- dence as a nation of large working population. These interests keep on changing with the dynamic world scenario.
India, a strong nation with the world’s largest democracy, is characterised by its international responsibility for peace and freedom. India has enshrined in its constitution values such as freedom and democracy. Being an active member in various international organisations, India pursues its quest for a safe and bet- ter world.
India’s security policy is based on its constitutional values of secularism, democracy, socialism, peaceful coexistence and pluralism. The central pillar of securely thinking is the strategic autonomy. The police are inclined towards non- military alliances but will select strategic partners. It is always the negotiated set- tlement, which is preferred. The employment of force is the last resort.

india’s security objective
India’s security objectives are:
•	To protect the citizens from security threats that arise in and out of the country and also to secure public and private properties against the destruc- tion caused by anti-national elements.
•	To safeguard the nation against the threat of conventional and non-
conventional weapons.
•	To apply the principle of panchsheel and to enhance co-operation with neigh- bouring countries to work together on various threats and violence.
•	To strengthen India’s strategic arms and systems to neutralise threats and
for counter-attacks. Indigenisation will help the nation to be independent from others.
 
 
•	To carry forward mutual co-operation and dialogues with major powers of the world.
•	To defend the country’s border, the land as well as the coastal border.

india’s security interests
India’s security interests are as follows:
•	Prevention and elimination of crisis and issues that endanger the national security and the security of our allies.
•	To strengthen south Asian and pan Asian security and partnership.
•	To support the values of universality of human rights and democratic ide- als, and to promote global acceptance of international laws and reduce income disparity among people.
•	Facilitation of free trade with no discrimination to the developing nations,
which ensures free communication without any interference across sea lanes, and free global trade is without any hiccups.

Present security Policy situation
The responsibility to handle external security threats lies with the Centre. The Ministry of Defence is the nodal ministry for India’s defence. The Ministry of Home Affairs controls paramilitary forces such as the Border Security Force, which exclusively guards the border areas, the Indo-Tibetan border police in the border of Nepal and Bhutan, the Central Reserve Police Force, etc. Therefore, the Ministry of Home Affairs also plays a very important role in securing the nation from external threats. Generally, the security policy comes under the defence ministry’s purview, but it is finalised by the cabinet. The Prime Minister plays an important role is shaping the security policy, assisted by the National Security Advisor.
The internal security situation comes under the purview of the states. Police forces are under the control of the state governments and any sort of internal dis- turbance is first controlled by the state’s forces. Our constitution has given that it is the responsibility of the centre to protect the state from any sort of aggression; thus, in cases where the situation goes out of hand, the centre deploys armed paramilitary forces such as the Central Reserve Police Force, BSF, ITBP, NSG, etc. The security policy is formed by the centre to control crises such as dealing with Naxalism when it extends beyond the boundaries of a single state, and then the state governments tend to adopt it. The centre may provide the services of the paramilitary forces.

lacunae in the Present Policy
There are various factors that make the security policy ineffective. The police, under the state government, are empowered to deal with local situations, but the constitution has provided the union government with the rights to intervene,
 
and this has caused many problems in power sharing between the centre and the states.
Economy is the major reason for the emergence of threats to internal secu- rity but is never considered to be a part of the security policy. The lack of coor- dination between the centre and the state affects the security policy. This lack of co-ordination affects the implementation process of law enforcement making it totally ineffective. Inefficient governance also affects the framing of the secu- rity policy. Less participation of the members of civil society, non-governmental bodies and people from grassroots levels lead to such policies that do not reflect the actual reality and the true aspiration of the people, which is more likely to fail.

Key eleMents of internAl security Doctrine
To formulate an effective internal security policy, we need to include the follow- ing elements in our internal security doctrine:
•	political situation,
•	socio-economic consideration,
•	governance,
•	police and other security forces,
•	co-ordination between the centre and state,
•	collection of intelligence,
•	border area management and
•	cyber security management.

Political situation
The political situation is some areas is disturbing. Identifying the nature of chal- lenge is important, and it can be on the basis of regional demands or secessionist, separatist tendencies. Identifying the cause of such movements is the key and it has to be made sure that the demands are within the constitutional framework. The state should deal secessionist movements with a heavy hand, and separatist movements should not be engaged in dialogue. The government must have a proper policy to handle such situations effectively. Measures have to be taken to heed regional and ethnic demands if the demands are within the legal and consti- tutional framework.

socio-economic consideration
It is generally argued and sometimes accepted that socio-economic consideration forms the basis of many internal security threat scenarios. The discontent of the people is genuine as they face shortage of jobs, money and food. These cases should be handled using a different approach. The reason of the agitation should be analysed, and grievances should be addressed. It has to be ensured that the fruits of development are spread without discrimination, and the value of equal- ity enshrined in the constitution is upheld.
 
 
governance
Anti-state movements launched by some motivated elements are due to the lack of good governance. The people develop ill feelings towards the state because of bad practices like nepotism, corruption, etc. Mismanagement of government funds, inefficient implementation of laws and misappropriation of schemes act as a trigger. To bring in accountability and transparency, it is highly essential to ensure people’s participation in governance.

Police and other security forces
Analysts point out that, in most cases, police and other security forces are not sensitised. These forces do not understand their role as a public servant and do not work towards the attainment of a common goal. They act piecemeal under a regimental system. Sometimes they are poorly trained and not motivated to face armed extremists, which in a number of occasions ends in police excesses and custodial deaths. These are few amongst many that are to be included in the new security policy. Therefore, it is essential to make amends to the police and other security forces to make it effective in addressing the people’s need in a transpar- ent and neutral manner. Co-ordination is essential between the security forces in order to face internal security threats.

co-ordination between the centre and state
It is arguably the lack of co-ordination which is the recurrent theme that magni- fies threat situations. This affects the supply of , which is necessary for the func- tioning of the security apparatus of the state. Thus, the security policy needs to address this issue of lack in co-ordination and co-operation between the centre and the states.

lntelligence
Intelligence it is one of the key components of internal security. Correct and timely intelligence is essential to keep in order both external and internal secu- rity threats. Without the backbone support of the intelligence, no mission can suc- ceed. Intelligence of both forms, defensive and offensive, is needed to forewarn and to take proactive steps to the impending threats and to ensure that the situation is under control. A nodal agency is the need of the hour to collect, gather and effec- tively utilise all vital strategic information effectively, which contains any threat.

border Area Management
Border area management is an emerging area. India has large and porous borders with neighbours. These regions are exploited by various insurgent groups from Kashmir and the northeast region, who hide in jungles across the border. There is huge trafficking of drugs, arms and ammunition since India is located in the
 
middle of the Golden Crescent and the Golden Triangle. The porous sea borders of India like the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are conducive for smug- gling. Complete co-ordination is necessary between various organisations and agencies to protect the border region. Co-ordination of the Navy, Coast Guard and the Marine Police is necessary for the effective management of sea routes. The Government of India has brought out a Coastal Security Scheme since 2010 to strengthen the coastal defence of the nation. The state police force is given responsibility of coastal defense.

cyber security Management
Cyber space is considered the next ground of warfare, which is the most vital instrument to prevent or cause a threat. The proper cyber security policy is essen- tial when we encounter the likes of the Edward Snowden issue. Threats come from anywhere and any form and cyber threat is one of the most distressing security threats. Thus, an effective security policy is needed, and the Department of Electronics and Information Technology has formulated the National Cyber Security Policy 2013 in the best interest of India.

internAl Policy Doctrine – essentiAl AsPects
All these policy measures serve to protect the nation against the threats which could have an effect on internal functioning. Only an internal policy doctrine that covers the overall defence and security system is competent to manage the threat.
Each and every group has its own uniqueness and ideology, which makes it tedious to formulate an internal security doctrine. We can separate it into two categories, viz. the physical and the psychological.
•	Physical:
◊ military capability,
◊ intelligence gathering,
◊ good governance and
◊ economic growth.
•	Psychological:
◊ readiness of the people to support the government in its initiatives and
◊ ideological counter-measures.

Physical component
Military capabilities
It is the capacity of the military to counteract the threat. It includes traditional military and internal security forces like the police, reserve police forces and other paramilitary forces. It is necessary to modernise these forces to counter escalating threats. They must also be motivated to deal with civilian population because without their support any counteracting measure will fail.
 
 
Intelligence gathering
Intelligence gathering is an important constituent in dealing with any sort of threat. Intelligence means information, which is useful and important. Thus, intelligence provides an insight in to dealing with insurgent activities. Counterintelligence measures entail military action and also help us analyse the ideology of anti-state movements and counter it effectively. Central intelligence agencies like the Intelligence Bureau and the State Police Intelligence are set up in India, and the key to fight terrorism is to collect accurate information and share it among stakeholders.
Good governance
Good governance is necessary to counter the internal threat by involving grass- roots organisations and civil society bodies. The voice of unheard populace will be heard only if concerns of grassroots people are addressed so that we can cre- ate an atmosphere of trust. Corruption, nepotism, etc. alienate people, and polit- ical and bureaucratic accountability is in question. Our security policy should address these governance lacunae so that these will not be the reason to wean away people to carry out anti-state activities.
Economic growth
Economics determines the status of people, their condition and the activities they carry out. Economic development and wealth distribution have a vital role in determining the internal security policy. Economic growth has not reached the targeted section of people; thus alienating the vast population. Such alien- ated people are swayed away easily to take up anti-national activities. The main reason for youngsters to join them is a lack of a job and a lack of  their place in the economic ladder. Thus, when a government creates an internal secu- rity policy, it must not forget the inclusion of the implications of economic development.

Psychological component
People’s support of government initiatives
The role of people is very vital that it should be considered in the security policy; else it is bound to fail. Without the support of civilians, any insurgent movement is short lived and can be easily shattered by the state. Enlisting civil- ian support is not a physical component; it is a psychological component as it involves the change in the mindset of the people. The effort of the government to secure civilian support is time consuming and can be achieved by providing them with the fruits of growth and good governance and employment. This effort of the government sensitises officials who deal with the people directly and ensure that they serve the public honestly. Winning the hearts and minds of the people is the beginning of ensuring support of the people towards govern- ment initiatives.
 
Ideological countermeasures
Anti-state movements have to be countered ideologically rather than adopting tra- ditional counter-insurgency measures. This is considered as a minor component and generally does not have a special focus in the internal security doctrine. Strong state doctrines that counter Maoist ideology are necessary to completely eradicate anti-state movements like Left Wing Extremists. These measures can create a huge psychological impact on militants and civilians, who can be involved in the gover- nance process and is the only way to growth and success.

Development and spread of extremism
The enhancement of human capabilities and entitlements, which includes education, health, infrastructure and the liberty of people is termed ‘development’. Therefore, development efforts should seek to improve human capabilities, knowledge and financial resources of the civilians thereby providing them with an opportunity to come out of poverty and deprivation and to lead a healthy, happy and honourable life.
The term extremism refers to the political or religious principle and actions of an extreme group that are unreasonable and unacceptable to most people. Extremists often condemn these with conflicting new points. The term extremist is subjective as one person’s freedom fighter may be another’s extremist.
Webster’s English dictionary defines extremism as “belief in and support for ideas that are very far from what most people consider correct is reasonable.” There are time-immersed arguments on the relationship between develop-  ment and extremism. They have a negative cyclical as the lack of development
leads to extremism, extremism renders development efforts useless.

unDerDeVeloPMent AnD extreMisM
The lack of development in the country creates discontent among the people, which in turn leads to extremism. This discontent and violence have been steadily mounting despite the numerous statutory and institutional mechanisms in place to address poverty deprivation thereby ensuring development to sections of peo- ple who are not touched by the developmental efforts.
The second ARC identifies the following governance-related factors that have led to the growth of extremism:
•	Corruption and poor, new provision of essential public services such as primary healthcare education, etc.
•	Incompetent, ill trained and poorly motivated public personnel who are
mostly absent from their place of posting.
•	Misuse of power by the police and violations of the norms of law.
•	Perversion of electoral politics and unsatisfactory working of local govern- ment institutions.
Poor and lack of proper socio-economic infrastructure among the tribal commu- nity is identified to be the main reason for their disempowerment.
 
 
A committee of concerned citizens in 1997 grouped the activities of Naxalites as strugglers of the rural poor and tribal people. It recognised it as a political struggle and not merely a law and order issue.
The above situations have therefore caused a feeling of alienation and anger among a large section of the population.
It is thus essential for the state to address these causes of anger and discon- tent in a human and democratic manner.
Underdevelopment has thus been a major cause of violence and extremism in the red corridors of the Naxal areas and northeastern states. It must be noted however that underdevelopment is not the cause of extremism and insurgence in Jammu and Kashmir. Historical and political factors are behind extremism in Jammu and Kashmir. But the extremism in these areas has continued to the underdevelopment of Jammu and Kashmir as with the northeastern states.

Terrorism is the tactic of demanding the impossible and demanding it at gunpoint.
– Christopher Hitchens
The biggest epidemic today that tears the social fabric and peace apart is terrorism. Terrorism is very diverse; it spreads across different dimensions – political and religious, and in different levels – global and local. These diversity pockets form a spectrum where it moves from one dimension to another and from one level to another. It even exhibits various faces at various points of time.
Terrorism is not new as it can be traced back to at least the 1st century when a group of people killed the collaborators of the Roman Empire in the Judea prov- ince. The origin of “terrorism” can be traced to the Reign of Terror of the last decade of the 18th century during the French revolution.
A shift in the nature of terrorist activities was seen across many countries post the Second World War. From Europe it shifted to the Middle East, Africa


2.1
 
and Asia with the rise of nationalistic and anti-colonial groups. Another fillip to terrorism was given on 11 September 2001. It brought to the fore the modern meaning terror activities as we see and experience today.
The terrorism that we see today is global in character and reach. It is marked by a large number of transnational groups predominantly having religious fun- damentalism as their core ideology. With Osama Bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda and Afghan’s Taliban to the latest ISIS religious fundamentalism-based terrorism, the phenomenon of terrorism seems to never die. If we suppress it in one form, it re-emerges in another form only more ruthless and more lethal.
The first step towards combating terrorism is by understanding what terrorism is and what it is not.

Terrorism – DefiniTion

According to the Global Terrorism Index, terrorism is defined as ‘the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, reli- gious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation’.
The Index is released by the Institute of Economics and Peace every year and India is the 6th most affected country in terrorism as given by the indices in 2014.
Despite terrorism attaining worldwide recognition as a global phenomenon, attempts to arrive at a globally accepted definition of terrorism have proved to be futile. The main reason being one man’s terrorist is another’s freedom fighter. Further, history is replete with examples of state-sponsored clandestine criminal acts and assassinations in other states to destabilise the other state and derive benefits out of the act. There is political resistance to have a universally accept- able definition of terrorism.
Politicians use the term terrorism for political purposes and paint their opponents as monsters. Academicians have tried to arrive at a definition much more objectively from a detached position. People seek to capture the essence of terrorism based on which side of the fence they sit.
However, be it politicians or academicians the definition of terrorism implying murder or characterising it as intrinsically wrong is agreed upon. This means we arrive at a moral conclusion without moral skepticism or debate. This discussion ends even before it begins.
Let us examine the definitions of ‘terrorism’ as proposed by different organizations:
(a)	League of Nations Convention (1937): describes terrorism as “all criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public.”
(b)	Article 2(1) of the UN General Assembly’s Draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (fifty-fifth session, 2000) provides that;
 
 
(1)	Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person, by any means, unlawfully and intentionally, causes:
(a)	Death or serious bodily injury to any person; or
(b)	Serious damage to public or private property, including a place of public use, a State or govern- ment facility, a public transportation system, an infrastructure facility or the environment; or
(c)	Damage to property, places, facilities, or systems referred to in paragraph 1(b) of this Article, resulting or likely to result in major economic loss, when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an interna- tional organization to do or abstain from doing an act.
The Defense Department of The United States of America defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence to instill fear and coerce governments or societies. Terrorism is often motivated by religious, political or other ideological beliefs and committed in the pursuit while taking into account these universally recognized definition, of goals that are usually political.”
What is considered unlawful? Is it the violation of the Geneva Convention, United Nations Resolutions or the US Federal Law? Well, in any country, if the law of the land on terrorism is violated, it becomes an act of terrorism. There are instances of some powerful nations that have used violence unlawfully. The threat of violence can also be an act of terrorism – one has no answer to such questions. In a nutshell, we do not have a universally accepted definition of terrorism, though we have a mental moral picture of what terrorism is. We limit ourselves to what conventionally has been portrayed as terrorism by public and media alike. Terrorism is any violent activity done by a non-state actor against common peo- ple or their property for political purposes. This definition would satiate our need
for now.

Non-state actors: An organization that has no direct or indirect links with the govern- ment and its organisation but has commendable political influence.


Types of Terrorism
Grouping all terrorists or terrorist activities under one umbrella is not possible because their variety and will only lead to poor understanding in combating ter- rorism. Understanding what we are dealing with is the first step to the battle against terrorism. Terrorists have different goals and objectives. The nature of terrorism varies in accordance with the objectives. The commonly distinguished types of terrorists are:

ethno-nationalist Terrorism
Daniel Byman defines ethnic terrorism as deliberate violence by a sub-national ethnic group to advance its cause.
 
Ethno-nationalists and separatists committed terror acts and dominated their agenda around the world for more than five decades until religious terror- ism occupied the centre stage. The two terrorist organisations which justified their acts of violence were the Irish Republican Army and Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA or Basque homeland and freedom) against the UK and Spain, respectively. Most of these violent acts usually focus on their motive of creating a separate state or the elevation of the status of an ethnic group. Tamil Nationalist groups in Sri Lanka, especially the LTTE, which fought war against Sri Lanka armed forces, since the 80’s till the 2009 war, is the world’s famous terrorist organisation. Insurgent groups in northeast India are also examples of ethno-nationalist ter- rorist activities.

religious Terrorism
Though the 21st century saw the decline of ethno-nationalist terrorism, it ush- ered in a new wave of global terrorism with religious inspiration and very high levels of brutality and lethality. Present-day religion-centered terrorist activities are global in nature. According to Hoffma, the terrorists are motivated wholly or partially by religious ideals, who consider violence as their divine duty or a holy act. It gives them different ways of legitimisation and justification when com- pared with other terrorist groups, and these unique factors make religious terror- ism more dangerous, more brutal in committing heinous acts.

rise of isis
What is isis?
The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as ISIL*, is a transna- tional militant organisation and an unrecognised proto-state that has received global attention since 2014. It began as the Iraqi wing of Al-Qaeda and later rebranded itself after a couple of years with its current name, ISIS. It carries forward anti-Western radicalism similar to Al-Qaeda and operates much more brutally in controlling occupied territory. Through its harsh methods and radical ideology, ISIS seeks to establish an independent theocratic state in the Middle East, free from western influence.

Where Do They operate from?
As the name suggests, ISIS has spread its base, capturing large territories on both sides of the Iraq–Syria border. The group has a number of oil fields under its control, which keep its day-to-day warfare and militant operations running. At its peak, the ISIS is said to have traded oil through black markets to the tune of
$3 million each day.
* ISIL: Islamic state of Iraq and Levant (Levant is the name of a geo- graphical area in the Middle East).
 
 
Though its strategy of geographical expansion is based on violence and warfare, ISIS establishes a concrete governing establishment once it fortifies captured territories. Similar to modern states, it has a bureaucratic structure, fea- turing governors and legislative and financial bodies, compositely headed by a Caliph, who holds the ultimate power.
Of late, ISIS has been pushed back into its territories by coalitions of Western militaries led separately by the United States (US), France and Russia. Notable cities recaptured by Western forces include Aleppo and Palmyra.

What Are Global powers Doing to Counter isis?
As ISIS has destabilised the conventional governance of Middle Eastern countries, several nations have launched counter efforts to tackle the group’s advances to other parts of the world. The US-led coalition titled as the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) formu- lated a strategy to expose ISIL’s true nature, cutting off ISIL’s funding and executing military operations to defeat it. Similarly, under the leadership of Saudi Arabia, around 34 Muslim countries have come together to form the Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism, which seeks to fight against the terrorist group.

Do They still pose a Threat to Global peace?
Despite the recent setbacks and the creation of military fronts against it, ISIS operates through its offshore cadres, triggering a number of terrorist attacks. By deploying a systematic hierarchy, the group covertly recruits cadres through its radical religious propaganda, mostly from developing countries to expand oper- ations. With this network of satellite units around the world, it triggers terror attacks that torment unsuspecting civilians. Thus, its ability to operate with lim- ited geographical presence and destabilise peaceful world order is quite potent and has to be seriously addressed.

Leftist Terrorism
History is studded with several cases of violence perpetrated by the peasant class against the ruling elite, which is called the leftist ideology.
However, it was Marx’s and Engels’s writings that actually acted as the ideological basis for the left and the subsequent violent movements. Lenin and Mao Tse-tung furthered these movements with their writings and actions. Leftist ideologies believe that all the existing social relations and socio-politico state structures in the capitalist society are exploitative in character and a revolutionary change through violent means is essential.
Few example, leftist groups are the Red Army Faction of former West Germany, the Red Brigades of Italy, the 17th November Movement of Greece, People’s Revolutionary Army and the Motoneros of Argentina. The Maoist groups in India and Nepal are also leftist groups.
 
rightist Terrorism
Right-wing groups generally are conservative in nature. These people either want status quo or want to return to a specific time in the past which they feel should be conserved. At times these right wing groups might assume ethnic/racist/religious character too. They may act as a pressure group and use violence or threat of violence as a means to force the government in to acquiring a territory or in to intervening in the affairs of a neighbouring country, the best example being the Nazi party of Germany. Closer home, the Tamil organisations supporting the cause of Tamil Eelem in Sri Lanka is an example for rightist terrorism. Violence perpetrated against migrant communities citing the concept of “sons of the soil” also comes under this category of terrorist violence. Some organisations in Assam and other northeast states are examples. It is to be noted here that religion can play a supportive role to rightist violence.
Examples include the Nazism in Germany, Fascism in Italy, Ku Klux Klan (a white supremacy movement in the US), Green Jackets of Denmark, etc.
state Terrorism
When the government systematically uses terror mechanisms to control its pop- ulation, it becomes a state terrorism. Here terrorism is entirely carried out by those holding power. They are the government in a country and they are not by a non-governmental organisation or non- state actor. In its original form it was witnessed during the 1793 French Revolution when thousands of executions were carried out by the Jacobins, which is often cited as the first instance of state terrorism. Rulers have been using this terror mechanism for centuries to control their subjects. Arguably almost every dictator in history has applied terror mecha- nism for controlling his population. More contemporary examples would be the use of violence by Saddam Hussein against the Kurds and other authoritarian regimes in the Middle East.
state-sponsored Terrorism
State-sponsored terrorism is a very old practice that existed in the empires of Rome, Byzantium, Asia and in Europe. The period between the 1960s and the 1970 saw the resurfacing of the state-sponsored terrorism on a large scale. Similar to religious terrorism, state-sponsored terrorism also has caused a wide transfor- mation in the nature of terrorist activities.
In the modern era, various nations have incorporated terrorism as a delib- erate tool of foreign policy. State-sponsored terrorism differs from other forms in that it is initiated to achieve certain defined foreign policy goals rather than seeking media attention or targeting the potential audience. A cost–benefit analy- sis would show that state-sponsored terrorism is the most effective means of ter- rorism from the standpoint of the perpetrator.
Central Asia had been the hub of state-sponsored terrorism in the 19th century. A few examples are Russians’ support to Slavs in the Balkans and Bulgaria’s exploitation of the Macedonian revolutionary terrorists against
 
 
Yugoslavia after World War I. Later during the Cold War era, the Western powers under the auspices of the US and the Soviet Union supported all kinds of nationalist, communist and anti-communist rebels to further their own foreign policy agenda. Countries like Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and North Korea fell victim to this state-sponsored political violence. India too is a victim of state-sponsored terrorism by Pakistan since Independence.

CAuses of Terrorism
The most common causes of terrorism as concluded out of many debates by various experts are listed below:
•	extreme poverty,
•	unequal distribution of resources,
•	economic exploitation,
•	over-population,
•	illiteracy,
•	unemployment,
•	extremism and sectarianism,
•	lack of opportunity,
•	weak social bond,
•	political instability,
•	deprivation of fundamental rights,
•	institutional evasions,
•	anathema of social injustice,
•	social imbalance and regional disparities,
•	proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD),
•	impact of proxy war of Afghanistan (1979–1989),
•	policies against Islamic Revolution of Iran (1979) and
•	political insurgency.
A few of the widely accepted causes are explained below:

ethno-nationalism
They are a group of people who desire to break away from the union govern- ment and wish to independently form a terrorist group. Ethno-nationalism as a cause has been in the scene since the time of the World War, and in the weaken- ing of imperial powers many notable groups like the Jewish Irgun Zvai Leumi in Palestine which fought British rule attained self-rule in the Jewish state.
There are many minority groups who wish to garner independence within many countries in the world. So ethno-nationalism is an important source of terrorism and to recognise it and actually counter it requires a politically inclu- sive approach to make sure that the grievances of the minority groups are achieved.
 
Alienation/Discrimination
Alienation is considered to be a major cause especially in Europe where people from poorer Muslim countries, who go to school and work, are often discrimi- nated. These people who could not get adapted to the culture of the host nation look for their diaspora and are often alienated with growing sentiments which will make them take conservative and extremist ideologies.

religion
It is highly believed today that terrorism is a major cause for terrorism. Terrorism is not preached by any religion, but by some spiritual leaders. Religion as a cause is highly referred to as Islamic Fundamentalism. One good example is the global Salafi-jihad, a conservative revivalist movement, which aimed to redeem the lost Muslim glory from Morocco to Philippines. The true hazard that the religious doctrines poses is its attitude to encourage the attacks that are more aggressive in nature. There has been an increase in the number of terrorist attacks since 1980.

socio-economic status
Poverty, lack of opportunity, inequality in resource distribution and lack of upward mobility in society are the socio-economic factors leading to terrorism. The awareness of various opportunities that are put forth by globalisation has increased the frustration and humiliation among the under-privileged. This feel- ing of being left out is a signal to terrorist organisations to the society towards them. Unfortunately, bringing development to the under-privileged is the only way to counter this and that might take a very long time.

political Grievances
Another major cause for individuals to join terrorist groups is the lack of politi- cal inclusiveness and the grievances against the political order. Expressing political will in frustration can lead to violence as an alternative to the existing political system that exists. These political desires are not out of the desire to create a new state but to change the current order.

meAns of Terrorism
The time-tested strategies used by terrorists are attacks on persons and property using fire arms, bombs, IEDs, grenades, landmines hostage-taking, hijacking and forcible take-over of buildings, especially government/public buildings. These could be categorised as conventional means of terrorism. Further, the trending strategy today is suicide attacks and kidnapping. There is impending danger of terrorists resorting to WMD (nuclear, chemical or biological), cyber terrorism and environmental terrorism.
 
 
environmental Terrorism
Environmental terrorism is the intentional damage caused to environmental resources so as to deprive the others of their use. For instance, on the orders of Saddam Hussein several oil wells were ignited to cover Kuwait in smoke during the GW I. Similarly during GW II, the forces of Hussein retreated, set ablaze all oil wells so as make them unusable for the NATO forces.

Weapons of mass Destruction
WMDs are weapons that can cause heavy and indiscriminate damage. According to NATO a Weapon of Mass Destruction is a weapon that is capable of a high order of destruction and of being used in such a manner as to destroy people, infrastruc- ture, or other resources on a large scale. The commonly recognized Weapons of Mass Destruction are nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. It is a matter of great relief that acquiring, storing and using these WMDs require a high level of knowledge and skills that the terrorist organisations are yet to acquire as of now.

Chemical Weapons
Any weapon which uses chemicals to cause severe human death or physical or psychological suffering and harm is considered a chemical weapon. They may take the form of poisoned arrows, arsenic smoke and noxious fumes, etc. In the First World War, chlorine and phosgene gases were released from canisters on the war field and were dispersed by the wind.
According to the Chemical Weapons Convention signed in 1993, any toxic chemical, regardless of its origin, is considered as a chemical weapon if it is used for purposes that are prohibited. The toxic chemicals that have been used as chemical weapons, or have been developed for use as chemical weapons, can be categorised as choking, blister, blood or nerve agents. The most well-known agents are as follows: choking agents – chlorine and phosgene; blister agents (or vesicants) – mustard and lewisite; blood agents – hydrogen cyanide; nerve agents – sarin, soman, and VX.
Iraq used chemical weapons on Iran during the war in the 1980s, and again used mustard gas and nerve agents on Kurdish residents of Northern Iraq in 1988. The standout usage of chemical weapons, however, is USA’s use of Agent Orange in the NAM war. Very recently, it is alleged that the Syrian Governmental Forces have used chemical weapons on its own citizens in the ongoing internal power struggle.

nuclear Weapons
A nuclear weapon is ammunition that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapon). They release huge quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. It is a widely known fact that the engineering skill and equipment needed to build the simplest form of nuclear weapon, a “gun” type bomb is not particularly complex. Any organised group can develop a nuclear weapon. The difficulty, however, lies in the non-availability and the complicated
 
process and the cost involved in enriching uranium. This is what makes it diffi- cult for the non-state actors and terrorist groups in assembling a nuclear weapon.
Biological Weapons
Biological weapons are weapons that use natural or modified biological mat- ter to inflict large-scale death and harm to human beings. It is relatively a new form of terrorist activity with terrorist groups being able to access and exploit the advancements in biotechnology. The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a bio-terrorism attack as “the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria or other germs (agents) used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants.” These are spread though air, water or food. To make things worse they are extremely difficult to diagnose since it may take anywhere between hours and several days for visible symptoms to appear.
During World War I, Germany is understood to have used Bacillus anthra- cis and Burkholderia mallei mainly against the livestock and military personnel of their enemies. Again during the Cold War several countries were alleged to have widely used chemical and biological weapons.
Cyber Terrorism
Cyber terrorism is an act of terrorism which uses the Internet to disrupt large- scale computer networks using computer viruses and other means. The term ‘cyber terrorism’ is a relatively new entrant to the lexicon of terrorism. Put it simply, it is the convergence of terrorism and cyber space. It is an unlawful attack against computers, networks and the information stored therein to intimidate a state and its people. Thus, cyber terrorism is the most advanced means of terror- ist strategy evolved parallel with the advancement in information and communi- cation technologies.
These are a few consequences of cyber terrorism:
•	Loss of integrity – unauthorised changes made to the data or IT system can result in inaccuracy, fraud or erroneous decisions that bring the integrity of the system under suspicion.
•	Loss of availability – an attack on a mission-critical IT system makes it
unavailable to the end users.
•	Loss of confidentiality – the consequences of  unauthorised disclosure of information range from loss of public confidence to national security threats.
•	Physical destruction – the ability to create actual physical harm or destruc-
tion through the use of IT systems.
In 1998, Sri Lankan embassies were swamped with e-mail bombs by ethnic Tamil militants. This is believed to be the first cyber terror attack in the world. In 2001, Chinese and American groups engaged in a series of cyber attacks against each other.
suicide Terrorism
Since the attack on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, the world has come to terms with reports of “suicide bombers.” A suicide attack is a violent
 
 
attack in which the attacker would die; meanwhile he or she expects to kill others and cause great destruction. Their main intention apart from killing is to cre- ate fear in the minds of the public. The modern manifestation of this tactic is the attack on high value target. US Marine barracks in Beirut were attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber in 1984 during the Lebanese Civil War.
The LTTE adopted this tactic successfully and in fact no other organisation comes even remotely close to the success rate of suicide attacks. Several high- profile deaths are associated with the suicide attacks of the LTTE. The assas- sination of Shri Rajiv Gandhi took place on 21 May 21 1991, which brought into focus the capability and ruthless brutality of the LTTE in suicide terrorism.
Jehadi terrorists took to suicide terrorism in the 1990s. The suicide attack by the Fedayeen has steadily been on the rise since then. The J&K Legislative Assembly attack in October 2001, the Indian Parliament attack in 2001 and the attack on the Akshardham Temple in Gujarat in 2002 are instances of fedayeen suicide attacks. The term ‘fedayeen’ means that the death of a suicide terrorist is not vital or is inevitable for the mission that he or she undertakes.

effeCTs of Terrorism
Terrorism destabilises governments, undermines civil society, jeopardises peace and security, and threatens economic and social developments.
– Ms. Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

Terrorism is a major problem the world over, and it has the potential to deterio- rate a country’s economy and can cause disgust between two or more countries. It also has a lot of geo-political consequences, societal and psychological impacts. Some of the effects are listed below:
1.	Damages caused to the life and property at the location of the attack.
2.	A country’s economy would push toward the recession stage as it will have an impact on the consumer’s confidence.
3.	Huge impact on the investor as businesses will go down.
4.	There will be a drastic increase in spending in the defense sector.
5.	Rise in ethno-centrism and xenophobia as a group experiences its solidarity in the face of violence.
6.	Disruption in the livelihood of the people.
7.	Post-traumatic stress disorder is a major psychological impact on the people.
8.	Counter-terrorism legislation that infringes on individual freedom and personal privacy.
9.	As a result of problem in peace and order, the potential revenue is lost for both the government and private organisations.
10.	The tourism industry will suffer drastically.
11.	Attacks may cause communal clashes among people.
12.	It creates a sense of insecurity among the people.
 
 
 
Terrorism in inDiA
Terrorism must be held to be wrong in every case.
– M. K. Gandhi
India has been a victim of vicious terrorism since independence. The most prom- inent has been the terrorism in Kashmir, which intensified in the 1980s and is still simmering on. However, terrorism in India is not to be understood as being synonymous with insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. Other than insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, we are faced with Left Wing Extremism, ethno-nationalism in northeastern States and religious terrorism pan India. The Punjab military is a thing of the past.


 
forms of Terrorism in india
Jammu and Kashmir insurgency
The origin of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir can be traced to the period after independence when Pakistan attacked India with a view to capture Jammu and Kashmir. Since then there has been a steady rise in terrorist attacks on the com- mon people and security forces alike. In 1980s, there was large-scale infiltration across the border, and there was an increase in number of insurgent groups, which resulted in forcing innocent persons to flee from the state. In the 1990s security forces were deployed in large scale in the boundary areas and within the state.
The more recent rise of Islamist fundamentalism and emergence of Al-Qaeda and ISIS have reinvigorated insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. However, they do not act as a direct threat. The real threat is from regional affili- ates such as Laskar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), HUM, HUJI and Al-Badr who share the same philosophy and outlook as that of their global giants, Al-Qaeda and Taliban, but have established distinct linkages capable of undertaking jihadi and terrorist activities on their own.
It may be mentioned here that JeM was formed by Masood Azhar, a former senior leader of Harkat-ul-Ansar who was released and handed over by India to the Talibans at Kandahar (Afghanistan) in exchange of the IC-814 hijacking hos- tages. JeM’s declared objective is to unite Kashmir with Pakistan. JeM cadres are known to have been involved in several suicide attacks in Jammu and Kashmir including the one on the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly in October 2001, and they are also known for attacks in the parliament of India in December the same year.
There has been a dramatic change in the violence profile since 2006 with soft targets like tourists, minorities and migrants being targeted by terrorists, where the profile is increased by nearly 50% over the previous years in 2012–13. The threat from the terrorist groups may also be said to have increased with the formation of the United Jehad Council, an umbrella organisation of 14 militant groups led by the Hizbul Mujahideen along with the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed acquiring the most modern and sophisticated weapons and known support from international terrorist groups.
Burhan Wani Issue
The mid months of 2016 were nothing short of a turbulent time in the Kashmir valley. The episode began with a video being uploaded onto YouTube, featuring a Hizbul Mujahideen militant by the name of Burhan Wani. In what was a rant against the Indian Army, the terrorist reportedly went on to seek the support of Kashmiris in his mission of liberating Kashmir. He was eventually killed in an encounter in July 2016 by the Indian Armed Forces, which led to widespread protests and rioting across the state.
Burhan Wani, the son of a village school headmaster, was a class X student, when he decided to become a militant. A bitter incident with the state police, in
 
which his brother was hurt, is said to have pushed him to take up arms against the government. Within months of the incident, Wani joined Hizbul Mujahideen. His rise within the ranks of the terrorist group is touted to be legendary as he was soon recognised as one of the familiar faces of militancy in Kashmir. With his persuasive social-media skills, he is said to have recruited several militants into Hizbul Mujahideen, which resulted in the number of natives in the group going well above the number of non-native militants. Besides masterminding attacks on the armed forces, he consistently appealed to radicalised Kashmiri youth to fight against the government.
Further to his killing, the state witnessed widespread protests, which turned violent and caused severe harm to civilians. The protesters went out of control and had to be dealt with novel measures by the security forces. It was in this con- text that the forces opened fire with lead pellets, which caused a high degree of severe injuries and drew criticisms from all parts of the country. Though they were said to be non-lethal, pellet sprays on protestors resulted in several people losing their vision, either partially or completely, with no possible scope for recovery.
As much as it sparked off the controversy over the deployment of pellet guns, the killing of Burhan Wani led to further radicalisation of youth in Kashmir. Now more than ever, it has become highly important for the armed forces and the government to gain the trust of the people in order to send the message that they’re committed to the mission of bringing development and restoring peace in the Kashmir valley.

Pellet Guns Controversy

Pellets:What Are They?	Usually deployed as a riot-control measure around the world, pellets are tiny pieces of lead shrapnel that are fired using specially de- signed pellet guns. Unlike conventional weapons, which fire bullets with a higher force and impact, these guns scatter hundreds of tiny spherical shots of lead with limited impact. These pellets cause immense pain on striking the human body and thus help in dispersing violent mobs.

Are Pellets Non-lethal?	Owing to the limited impact caused when hitting a target, pellets are considered to be non-lethal. However, this holds good only when they’re fired from a reasonable distance. If they hit soft tissues such as eyes or temples, they are likely to cause lethal injuries.

Significance of Pellet Guns in India	Pellet guns were first introduced in 2010 in Jammu and Kashmir to deal with violent mob-like situations. Recently, during the Burhan Wani protests, pellet guns received a lot of attention in the media as their deployment led to lethal injuries for a lot of civilians. Some of them lost their vision either partially or completely, due to pellets being lodged in their eyes. Even in cases where pellets were surgically removed, vision wasn’t restored fully.
 
In order to avoid such controversies in future, the government constituted a panel of experts to suggest viable alternatives that are devoid of such hazards. In this respect, the panel proposed the use of non-lethal, chilli-based ammuni- tion, called PAVA (pelargonic acid vanillylamide) as an alternative. The panel noted that PAVA would temporarily immobilise and paralyse a victim, which could help in bringing the situation under control, with minimal damage.
In February 2017 the CRPF issued a statement saying that they would con- tinue using lead pellets, after raising concerns on the efficacy of PAVA as an alternative riot-control implement. While they stressed on retaining pellet guns as the major riot-control measure, they did mention that these guns would be modi- fied in order to avoid the pellets striking the protesters’ upper body.
Other Riot-Control Measures Used Across the World

Tear Gas	Formally known as lachrymators or lachrymatory agents, tear gas deployment is a commonly used method to disperse crowds. The gas causes irritation to the eye and generates a mild difficulty in breathing. It is deployed either in canisters via grenade launchers or through drone dispensers. Com- monly, cyanocarbons such as CS (2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile) and CN
( -chloroacetophenone) are used for the purpose. Similar methods include the use of smoke bombs and stun grenades. While smoke bombs are essentially fireworks that generate a lot of smoke, which impedes vision, stun grenades are non-lethal explosives that create a blinding flash with deafening noise that disorients protestors temporarily.

Baton Rounds	These are non-lethal ammunition that can be shot using either conventional or specially designed riot-control firearms. They can cause consid- erable pain and, at times, even bruises and muscular spasms. Variants of baton rounds come in lead, rubber, plastic and wooden finishes. In order to avoid hit- ting sensitive body parts, officers are instructed to aim at extremities. However, these can kill a person besides causing severe injuries, when shot within a close range.

Water Cannons	Water cannons are another commonly used method to deal with rioting and mass mobs. The volume, speed, odour and temperature of the water sprayed are different variables that riot-control units can work around to manage unruly crowds. In India, they were used in the aftermath of the destruction of Babri Masjid in 1992.

Physical Barriers	At times, riot-control units use containment strategies to bring a crowd under control. Barricades, fences, bamboo shields etc. can be used for this purpose. These barriers help in either directing people towards or away from
 
a particular direction. When done by field officers themselves, this can also help in trapping people at particular spots, so as to identify offenders or to enable mass arrests. However, due to its indiscriminately collective nature, at times even bystanders could be tagged as offenders.

Wave Weapons	These are non-physical deterrents that can incapacitate people through electromagnetic and sonic waves. Commonly called as a heat-ray device, the active denial system emits a directed electromagnetic energy blast, which can penetrate the human skin and trigger a sense of burning even though there isn’t any physical damage done. Another less technically sophisticated yet impact-
ful device is the sonic cannon. It sends amplified sound waves that can create discomfort or severe pain, which make protestors run for cover.

Ethno-nationalism in northeastern states	The history of the northeastern states of India is riddled with conflict and violence among the tribal groups within the same state, and also against neighbouring states. A large geographical area of this region was originally within the ambit of the state of Assam but ethno-na- tionalistic terrorism led to the formation of some of the present states through various stages of evolution during the post- Independence period. This topic has been dealt with in detail in chapter 4.

Left-wing extremism	Left-wing extremism is based on the communist ideology of the establishment of a rural peasant class in the ruling position. It closely follows Mao Tse-tung’s pathway in India. It started in Naxalbari village, West Bengal, in 1967 by an extremists’ break-away faction of the CPM. This extremist faction was convinced that the conditions were ripe in India to commence its so- called agrarian revolution. After the initial outburst, groups occupied the vacant lands of Naxalbari village, which they considered as land holdings in excess to the permissible limit.

Punjab militancy	The messy divorce of India and Pakistan had left the Punjab region of the erstwhile geographical region of Punjab in turmoil. Soon after the partition a journey for a separate Sikh identity emerged along with a demand for a separate state in India. Despite the formation of a separate state of  Punjab, the issues of Chandigarh as the state capital, river water sharing and other issues kept the emotions high and always had the state on the edge. With the entry of terrorist elements, the situation worsened and culminated in the secessionist demand in the form of ‘Khalistan’. This wave of terrorism came to an end and took along with it the life of former PM Indira Gandhi. Though terrorism came to an end, the issues pertaining to the conflicts and turbulence were very much alive. The Rajiv Gandhi–Longowal Accord in July 1985 was supposed to bring a lasting solution for the turbulence. However, with the assassination of Longowal
 
the following month, the accord faced turbulence in implementation and vio- lence erupted again. Finally, the conflict was resolved through various govern- ment policies of conciliation with different stakeholders. Still, there are isolated reverberations even today but they mainly spring from sections living abroad. This is an example of success of security forces, particularly of the police force of the state in stamping out terrorism from the soil. Punjab has been peaceful since then.

Religious terrorism	There have been several terrorist attacks India which have been linked to religious fundamentalism. While previously all religious funda- mentalism-related terrorist attacks were associated with Islamic fundamentalism, the last two decades witnessed terrorist attacks associated with Hindu funda- mentalism, infamously called “saffron terror”. Some of the religion activities overlap with political ambitions of separate Jammu and Kashmir and capturing electoral gains. Some of these attacks have even been supported and sponsored by external forces inimical to India.
While most of the terrorist attacks such as the Mumbai serial blasts of 1993, the Lajpat Nagar attacks of 1996, attacks on the parliament in 2001 and Akshardam in 2002, the Mumbai attacks of 2008, etc. are associated with Islamic Fundamentalism, the more recent burning alive of e Australian Christian mission- ary and his children in 1999, the Samjhauta Express bombings of 2007, the Ajmer Dargah attack of 2007, the Malegaon blasts of 2008 and the Mecca Masjid bomb- ing of 2007 are being alleged to have been the acts of Hindu fundamentalists.

AnTi-Terror LAWs in inDiA
The freedom of individual must take second place to the security of the State
– Lord Denning Terrorism has badly affected India in many forms and the reasons may vary from religious cause and factors like poverty, unemployment and under-development, etc. In 1994, the Supreme Court of India observed that India was held in the firm grip of increasing terrorist violence and was caught between the fatal pangs of disruptive activities in the Kartar Singh case against the state of Punjab.
Anti-terrorism laws in India are filled with controversies as the arguments rise up stating that these laws affect the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III that are enshrined in the Constitution. There were many anti-terror laws created by the legislature in the past and were accepted by the judiciary with no hesitation and the motive was to enforce them properly until the situation got better. As the situation persisted and aggravated, these laws were reintroduced with indispensable changes.
Terrorism as an offence does not figure in the Indian Penal Code of 1860 or in the statute as amended from time to time. In India, the first special law which attempted to define terrorism was the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities
 
(Prevention) Act, 1987, which was followed by the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA). With the repeal of the latter in 2004, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, was amended to include the definition of a ‘terrorist act’. The measures that are included in these are:
The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, which was amended in 2008, defines a ‘terrorist act’ as –“whosoever, does any act with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country:
A)	By using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisonous or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological radioactive, nuclear or otherwise) of a hazardous nature or by any other means of whatever nature to cause or likely to cause–
(a)	Death of, or injuries to, any person or persons; or
(b)	Loss of , or damage to, or destruction of property; or
(c)	Disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community in India or in any foreign country or
(d)	Damage or destruction of any property in India or in a foreign country used or intended to be used for the defence of India or in connection with any other purposes of the government of India, any state government or any other agencies; or
B)	Overawes by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force or attempts to do so or causes death of any public functionary or attempts to cause death of any public functionary; or’
C)	Detains, kidnaps or abducts any person and threatens to kill or injure such persons or does any other act in order to compel the government of India, any state government  of a foreign country or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act commits a terrorist act.”
The above act was enacted to deal with the terrorist activities that will prove to be hazardous to the territorial integrity of the nation. The sphere of the Act was sternly limited to meet the challenge regarding the territorial integrity of India and the Act was a self-contained code for declaring terrorist asso- ciations as unlawful, tribunal adjudication, prevention of funds and places of work of these unlawful associations, penalties for the members of these asso- ciations, etc. The Act is placed under the central list in the 7th Schedule of the Constitution.

Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016
In an era when terrorism causes immense destruction to unsuspecting civilians, aviation safety becomes a vital concern for governments world over. With the Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016, the Indian government aims to provide a comprehen- sive solution to deter and deal with hijacking situations. With this law India has manifested its commitment to the Hague convention, 1971, and Beijing protocol, 2010, which deal with air safety.
 
positive Aspects of the Act
•	This act expands the scope of defining the term ‘hijacking’. Therefore, an activity that aids or encourages the hijacking of an aircraft will also be dealt with the same gravity.
•	The law has a large horizon as it can be applied not only in India but also in
certain international conditions (e.g., when a hijacked plane of international origin is carrying an Indian passenger).
•	It provides for the confiscation of movable and immovable assets of the
offenders.
•	There will be a designated court to handle hijacking offences, which would hold trial on a day-to-day basis as far as possible to ensure speedy delivery of justice.
•	Death penalty will be enforced even if ground staff is killed during the
process of hijacking.

Areas for improvement
•	The act applies only to civilian aircrafts and does not include those used by enforcement agencies such as police, customs etc.
•	The panic of hijacking begins with the receipt of information. Whether
authentic or not, the information about a plane’s hijacking can disrupt the normal process of working in an airport. It puts security agencies on red alert and requires the entire airport to be secured. Unfortunately the act falls short of dealing with perpetrators who make hoax calls.
•	The act does not clearly define the terms ‘hostage’ and ‘security personnel’.
•	Also the act does not provide penalties regarding any collateral damage (even death of civilians) that could arise out of counter-hijacking opera- tions conducted by security agencies.
•	Moreover, there is no section on providing extra-territorial status for hos-
tages, when an Indian plane lands in a foreign state.
Despite the shortcomings, the act goes a long way towards tightening aviation security against hijacking.
The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 defines a terrorist as “whoever with intent to overawe the Government as by law established or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people or to alienate any section of the people or to adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or lethal weap- ons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause, or as is likely to cause, death of, or injuries to, any person or persons or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community, or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government or any other per- son to do or abstain from doing any act, commits a terrorist act.”
 
This Act is the second major act after the Unlawful Preventions Act, and this had more harsh provisions compared to the previous acts. The Act initially faced many challenges as critics argued that the Act was unconstitutional as it affected the basic human rights, but later the Act was validated by the apex court. The Act lapsed in 1995 as the enforcement official misused the harsh provisions of the Act.
According to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002, a terrorist is whoever
(a)	“with intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other sub- stances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature or by any other means whatsoever, in such a manner as to cause, or likely to cause, death of, or injuries to any person or persons or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community or causes damage or destruction of any property or equipment used or intended to be used for the defense of India or in connection with any other purposes of the Government of India, any State Government or any of their agencies, or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act;
(b)	is or continues to be a member of an association declared unlawful under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, or voluntarily does an act aiding or promoting in any manner the objects of such association and in either case is in possession of any unlicensed firearms, ammunition, explosive or other instrument or substance capable of causing mass destruction and commits any act resulting in loss of human life or grievous injury to any person or causes significant damage to any property, commits a terrorist act”.
Further, according to POTA, a Terrorist Act also includes the act of raising funds intended for the purpose of terrorism.
With the increase in cross-border terrorism and the sustained hateful agenda of the ISI of Pakistan targeting at the destabilisation of India and the developments after 11th September, it became high priority to put in to place a stringent law dealing with activities of the terrorists. Hence, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002, came into force.
The Act grants extraordinary powers to the investigating authorities, and the apex court upheld the constitutional validity of the POTA Act by stating that the parliament possesses powers to enact the law under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the Act is the need of the hour in the case of people’s union of Civil Liberties vs Union of India (2004).
Special safeguards were also provided to ensure that the powerful provi- sions in the Act are not misused and also to look in that the human right violation does not take place. Some of these provisions are:
Prior permission of the centre or the state government is always necessary to the cognisance of any offence to the court.
 
No officer lower than the Deputy Superintendent of Police rank can inves- tigate the offences. · Confession made by a person to police personnel not below the SP rank is acceptable as the evidence must be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours along with the statement of confession.
The misuse of power by any officer is punishable under the act, and com- pensation will be provided to the affected person.

prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002
The controversial anti-terror law of India – Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) – came into being after strenuous debates and discussions. The unpopu- larity of the bill among the legislators can be understood by the fact that the bill was rejected by the upper house and had to be passed only through a joint sitting. Initially introducing it as an ordinance, the Ministry of Home Affairs offered sev- eral justifications for its promulgation. It came in at a time when terrorist attacks were gaining intensity and insurgent groups were building strong bases in differ- ent parts of the country.
Though now it has been repealed, POTA lives as an example showing the bold step taken by India in its fight against terrorism. Throughout its life and the days that followed its repeal, a few of its provisions were at the core of debates between political parties, media and social activists. The possibility of it being misused against minorities and political opponents was seen as the most obvious threat to a liberal democracy that is India. This fear was not ungrounded. The decade-long experience with the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention (TADA) Act gave legitimacy to the fear that misuse of such sensitive laws give raise to serious human-rights issues.
POTA provides for criminal liability for mere association or commu- nication with suspected terrorists without the possession of criminal intent. Also it takes a legal presumption that if a person is found in unauthorised possession of arms in a notified area, he/she is automatically linked with ter- rorist activity. Additionally, pretrial detention for up to 6 months is another provision which can keep a person in custody with absolutely no reason being given for arrest.
It was repealed in 2004 after the government changed hands to a differ- ent political alliance. In order to fill the vacuum that had been created due to the repeal of the act, considerable amendments were brought to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. All terrorist organisations banned under POTA would continue to remain banned, under the Unlawful Activities Act, after the repeal of POTA.

The attack resulted in the deaths of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed.
 

pATHAnkoT ATTACk, 2016
The Pathankot airbase is one of the most important defence sites of India, con- sidering its proximity to the India–Pakistan boundary, in Punjab. This airbase was to wake up to a shocking start to 2016, when it became the focal point of a ter- rorist attack by a group of 6 heavily armed people from across the border. The perpetrators are said to have made use of a tall tree near the perimeter fence and nylon ropes to sneak into the airbase. Along with them, they are said to have car- ried large stocks of ammunition and assault weapons. The tall elephant grass near the point of breach and malfunctioning floodlights were used by these militants to their advantage.
By deploying a strategy that combined stealth and surprise, the terrorists opened fire at security personnel. In the counter operation that went on for sev- eral hours to eliminate the band of militants, 7 officers including a Garud com- mando were killed.
In the wake of the attack, the national capital was put on high alert. Strategically important cities, ports and government buildings were put on
 
high alert. Shoot-on-sight orders were issued to IAF bases of the Western Air Command, in the event of a terrorist attack.
It was later identified by Indian intelligence agencies that the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad was the mastermind behind the attack, which aimed at destroying aircrafts and helicopters at the base. The attack drew strong con- demnations from countries across the globe and put the ongoing diplomatic talks between India and Pakistan in a freeze.
The Pakistani government issued its condemnation of the attack and offered to cooperate with the Indian authorities to investigate the terrorist attack. This was promptly reciprocated by Indian officials, and the two teams began the investigation. However, the request by India’s National Investigation Agency to visit Pakistan for investigation was turned down by the Pakistani government. This brought the investigation of the terror attack to a standstill and has resulted in straining the ties between India and Pakistan.

uri Attack
Following the Pathankot attack, yet another Indian defence establishment close to the border was attacked by a band of 4 militants. The Indian Army brigade headquarters at Uri became the epicentre of a grenade-and-gun battle between Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists and the Indian Armed Forces personnel.
It began before dawn on September 18 and went on till close to noon. The attack began with 17 grenades being lobbed within 3 minutes on an administra- tive base camp. It claimed the lives of 17 army personnel, and retaliatory fire ensued. All of the 4 militants were killed in the 6 hour long conflict, and nearly 30 soldiers were injured.
An analysis of the attack gave insights about the loopholes in security around defence bases in India. It was believed that the militants used tall grasses and bushes along the perimeter fences to sneak into the base, similar to the Pathankot attack months ago.
The attack became another incident, which led to the withdrawal of India from diplomatic efforts with Pakistan. India strongly condemned the attack and decided to skip the SAARC summit to be held in Islamabad in November 2016. As an aftermath, within 11 days, India launched a series of surgical strikes, which cleaned up terrorist launch pads along the line of control in Pakistan. Though the attack was denied by the government of Pakistan, the execution of surgical strikes became a landmark achievement for the Indian government.

sTeps To CounTer Terrorism
The one-size-fits-all approach cannot be considered to be the best method to counter terrorism as every terrorist organisation has different motives and ideologies. Counter-terrorism policies have to be holistic and multi-pronged encompassing all systems – social, political, legal and economic. It has to be evolved in the overall context of national security strategy rather than viewing
 
it narrowly as just terrorism. National security includes security of life and prop- erty of every citizen in the country, which is individualistic and also the com- mon wealth of the nation, which belongs to all. While ensuring protection of life and property of all has dominated the discourses of national security, it has to be understood that a meaningful secure environment is possible and sustainable only when it factors in socio-economic development. In other words, the under- lining cause of terrorism should be addressed.
To counter terrorism, socio-economic development should be made a pri- ority so that vulnerable, deprived and disadvantaged sections of society do not fall prey to the false propaganda of terrorists. The administration should become sensitive to the needs and grievances of the citizens. Specially, the service deliv- ery methods must be responsive to the long-awaiting grievances of the people so that these are looked into immediately and cannot be left to be exploited by terrorist organizations. To make this a reality, the Justice system and the Law Enforcement Agencies have to be supported with the required legal framework, ample training infrastructure, equipment and intelligence.
The holistic approach shall require the involvement of all the stakeholders – the government, political parties, security agencies, civil society and media. This strategy should bring together political, social, economic, administrative, police and other measures. The essential components of such a strategy are:
Political will and consensus: Often, we find that the tussle between the union and states, lack of synchronisation of counter-terrorist policies and mechanisms between them lead to slip ups in security. Political parties should have the will power to put aside differences and work for consensus realising that all parties are supposed to work for the people’s welfare and that they all have to work towards the same cause. There should be a national plan within which the plans of the States and Union Territories are consolidated. All plans should be clearly demarcated and accountability has to be fixed to each entity. The Union should provide for necessary technical and tactical support to the States and Union Territories. The communication between the Union and the States/Union Territories must be two-way so that intelligence flow will be smooth. While bidding to build a national consensus on an issue of significant criticality such as countering terrorism, it has to be borne in mind that it is only plausible if the national as well as regional parties rise above their sectarian and petty electoral compulsions.
Socio-economic development: Poverty is one of the major causes and the breeding grounds for terrorism. It is often the deprived and alienated sections of the society who fall victims to the terrorist propaganda. The way out is to bring about overall socio-economic development. The growth in the economy should be inclusive so that the poor get their due share which would enable them to come out of the vicious circle of poverty and associated factors such as unemployment and underemployed that drive the youth to take up terror or disruptive activities.
 
Good Governance: Socio-economic development can be truly made pos- sible only when policies are actually implemented in letter and spirit. A clean, corruption-free and accountable administration at all levels is imperative.
Co-ordinated and specialised units: Countering terrorism is not routine law enforcement; it is a specialised job which requires high levels of coordination and intelligence mechanism. The police forces are already overburdened with their routine work that it is not possible for them to expend the time and energy that counter terrorism demands. A specialised body of forces to deal exclusively with terrorism-related national security is the need of the hour. Further, they will have to work in tandem with the local terrorism police who will have the widest reach among the local public.

surgical strikes
A surgical strike is an attack carried out by military forces by entering deep into hostile territory and executing assaults on legitimate targets with little or no col- lateral damage to surrounding areas. In September 2016 the Indian Army crossed the Line of Control (LOC) and proceeded deep into the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) territory and attacked multiple terrorist launch pads that were operating along the border. It was carried out by Indian Army Para Commandos. Each launch pad was estimated to have around 30 to 40 terrorists, and the army said that there were massive casualties of terrorists, guides and handlers.

Global Terror Database
The Global Terror Database is a repository of nearly 11,000 terror suspects, fea- turing their nationality, photographs, fingerprints etc., maintained by the Terrorist Screening Centre (TSC) of the US government. It is a compendium of terrorist watch lists under the possession of different enforcement agencies in the United States.
In June 2016, the Indian Home Ministry signed a memorandum of under- standing (MoU) to join the Global Terror Database in order to enhance the efforts in counterterrorism cooperation between India and the United States. With this MoU, India became a formal entrant into the US Homeland Security Presidential Directive-6 (HSPD-6). There are 30 other countries that have also signed similar agreements with the United States to cooperate in the sphere of counterterrorism.
Though the proposal had been doing the rounds since 2012, it couldn’t see the light of day due to reservations of Indian intelligence agencies about the program. The Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) didn’t approve of the initially proposed unhindered access of India’s terror- ist database that would be given to the US government. But the statement issued by the Home Ministry said that the access of information will be subject to terms and conditions: ‘Under this arrangement, both sides will give each other access
 
to terrorism screening information through designated contact points, subject to domestic laws and regulations.’

Benefits of mou
•	The agreement enables India to access biographic details of terrorists and terror suspects from around the globe.
•	It will help India’s counterterrorism initiatives in nabbing potential terror-
ists, their launch pads and sleeper cells.
•	As India is now a formal entrant into the US HSPD-6, it opens the possi- bilities for joint operations against terrorist groups.
Countering terrorism psychologically: Terrorist activities are aimed at cre- ating fear in the minds of the people. They feed on the fear of people in order to strengthen themselves. This psychological warfare has to be aptly countered by the government. The government should emphasise on civilian resistance to counter terrorism. Management of information services and the media, in con- junction with the intelligence wing of the police, can play an important role in achieving this objective.
Providing the appropriate legal framework: Terrorism is not just a crime against an individual or a society, but it is a crime against the sovereignty of the state. Normal laws like IPC apply to ordinary crimes, whereas it proves to be ineffective against extraordinary crimes like terrorism. To some extent we have appropriate specialised laws such as the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and The Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002. However, they have to be strengthened to deal effectively with terror-related activities. But to prevent its misuse by the Police Machinery, we need to have a proper mechanism.
Capacity building: The capacity building should take place at all levels and among all the stakeholders. It should extend to all agencies involved in anti-terrorist activities, civil administration and the society included. Secular education, a strong legal system and ICT-enabled critical technology-based infra- structure should be used to effectively counter terrorism.
Cutting down the finances: Terrorist activities require substantial financial support. Apart from the proceeds of illegal operations such as drug traffick- ing, counterfeit currencies, smuggling, money laundering and ransom money such funding could be sourced even from the proceeds of lawful activities. People who support militant ideology contribute money from their own source of income and could also do it as contributions that are made to non-profit and charitable organizations, which act as a proxy to terrorist outfits. Strong laws, intelligence and transnational treaties have to be put in place to choke the terrorists. It’s plain and simple – No funds No guns, No guns No Violence, No Violence No Threat. It’s by blocking the financial sources that LTTE were finally defeated.
 
 
roLe of pAssive sTAkeHoLDers
Citizens are passive stakeholders – the civil society, political parties, schools and colleges and media. Though we term them as being passive stakeholders, they indeed are capable of tipping the scales in favour of our war against the ter- rorists. A multi-dimensional response to combat terrorism would require well- coordinated action on all fronts and each of these agencies/institutions has an important role to play.
educational institutions
The genesis of violence in the society lies in the disharmony between various groups based on social, economic, political and ideological differences. This dis- harmony does not always erupt into violence, it rather lays dormant and gets accumulated. It reveals in situations of latent conflicts and escalates into violent outbreaks. Such outbreaks can be easily exploited by the anti-national elements and terrorism can be served on a platter. Schools and colleges play a significant role in bringing about lasting peace in the society. Education also has a role in creating a proper environment for peace. Through secular knowledge and wide exposure they dispel ignorance making the individual appreciate the diversity. They bring about a harmonious and cohesive society. Such an educated person is less likely to be influenced by a terrorist’s ideology.
The National Focus Group on Education for Peace set up by the NCERT suggested that:
i.	schools are potential nurseries for peace since school education involves the formative years in a person’s life during which children can be oriented to peace rather than towards violence;
ii.	teachers can be social healers by going beyond the academic syllabi to focus on pupil-centered education in order to inculcate human values in the students and
iii.	peace skills promote academic excellence because the capacity to listen, to co-operate with each other and to develop a positive attitude is the hallmark of a good student as well as that of a peace-oriented person.
NCERT has accordingly proposed a scheme to encourage and support institu- tions, voluntary agencies and NGOs. It is engaged with school education for the promotion of Education for Peace within the country. These initiatives need to be encouraged with necessary funds and other material support.
Religious educational institutions like madrasas and gurukuls could play a major role in bringing about peace. In fact, given the current levels of intolerance and communal hatred, one will be seldom surprised to hear that about a funda- mentalist terrorist attack. In such circumstances it becomes imperative to have a holistic strategy for the promotion of Education for Peace, covering secular as well as religious schools. The feasibility of extending this scheme as suggested by the NCERT to religious schools should be considered.
 
Civil society
Civil society forms an important component of governance. It plays a supple- mentary and complementary role to the traditional governmental effort. There has been a significant increase in the participation of civil society groups in pub- lic affairs. They happen to become the last mile connectivity tool to the gov- ernment. They have been playing an active role in bringing the grievances of the citizens to the notice of the government. They act as a mediator and nego- tiator of sorts between the government and the citizen. This proximity of the civil society groups to the masses has the potential to be used by the state in its fight against terrorism. They could be used for collecting information, educating the public thereby weaning them away from terrorist ideology in bringing about social inclusion and addressing socio-economic deprivation, which is the impor- tant cause of terrorism getting a stronghold.
Partnership can be established between law enforcement agencies, emer- gency response teams and civil societies and NGOs. All these agencies come up with programmes on spreading awareness and understanding the diversity of local cultures, religious customs and traditions of certain communities and act as arbitrators and conciliators in conflict resolution and easing tensions. An alert citizenry is perhaps the best way to ward off terrorist strikes. Civil society work- ing in synchronism with the agencies of the State can help in developing this capability among the citizens.

media
Media is like a two-edged knife. The usage depends on the hand that holds it. In the hands of the terrorists, it spreads fear, panic and chaos among the public. If used effectively by the state it can be used to spread peace, hope and harmony. As the Fourth Estate, the media has always played a major role in public life. It not only reflects public sentiments but also creates public opinion. With the evolu- tion of social networking, the coverage, extent and reach of media have become unlimited. Today the media exerts more influence on the minds of the people than any other point in time. Media reports can spread rumours, create havoc, instigate and spread violence, but they are also capable of bringing about peace with careful and ethical dissemination of information.
Terrorists too crave and thrive on publicity. The main objective of terror- ists is to induce psychological fear in the minds of the public and the govern- ment alike. The media does not intend to promote the cause of terrorism, but the nature and mandated function of the media – to cover events, developments and issues – can be exploited by the terrorists. Thus, unintentionally, the media may serve the expectations of the terrorists. The media should understand that terrorists are exploiting them to further their causes and should address them adequately so that they unwittingly do not form a part of the nefarious schemes of the terrorists.
 
 
The media is a powerful tool but if the government ignores its poten- tial, it can be a lethal combination in the fight against terrorism. The govern- ment should work towards harnessing the power of the mass media as a part of its strategy to defeat terrorism. The government should have a special Public Relations Team that would exclusively deal with the media in an attempt to use media to its advantage.
To use media as an effective tool against terrorism, the Administrative Reforms Commission has advocated for the need to have a media policy based on:
a.	Transparency in governance.
b.	Easy access to information and sources.
c.	Advancing the media’s role as an instrument of vigilance to scrutinise and check administrative, legal and judicial violations and excesses that endan- ger civil and democratic rights in situations of conflict and terrorism.
d.	Engaging, enabling, encouraging and assisting the media to fulfill its role of informed, fair and balanced coverage of crisis, particularly terrorism.
Media sensitisation should form an important component of media governance. Publishers, editors and reporters need to be sensitised to avoid and exclude those elements of media coverage that may unwittingly advance the agenda of terror- ists. Self-regulation of media should be encouraged.

roLe of soCiAL meDiA in Terrorism
Terrorists are finding newer ways to carry out attacks across the world. Increasingly, they are using social media to recruit, radicalise and raise funds to carry out their terror operations. ISIS is one of the most adept practitioners of this approach. By recruiting highly skilled people, terrorist organisations are able to craft radical messages and conceal them through state-of-the-art encryption tools.
They make use of social-media sites to post videos on fundamentalism, beheadings and warnings to government agencies. Though the parent companies of these social-media platforms keep eliminating their user accounts, they keep registering with new identities and continue posting online. A good example is the case of Twitter suspending more than 1,000 accounts, which were suspected to be operated by terrorists or their sympathisers.
While it is proving to be a tough challenge to control the proliferation of such messages, intelligence agencies are able to track potential terrorists through social media. Using tailor-made algorithms, social-media accounts can be moni- tored effectively and can provide clues on the upcoming plans of such terror suspects. The bigger challenge, however, lies in educating the vulnerable popula- tion of youth to not fall prey to these fanatic outbursts and calls for martyrdom. If the youth can be trained about the advantages and disadvantages of social media, especially in the realm of terrorism and extremism, it can play a vital part in addressing the issues of global and regional terrorism.

NAxAliSm – THE gENESiS
To understand the genesis of the Naxalite movement, one has to look at it through the lens of the Communist Movement in India, which culminated in one of the biggest security threats of our nation.
In 1925, the communist party of India was formed by the group of young patriots drawing their inspiration from the Great October Revolution with an aim to liberate India from the Capitalist and the Colonial Oppression.
The biggest fillip to the communist movements was the Telangana Struggle. It marked a paradigm shift in the evolution of the Communist Movement. This
3.1
 
struggle helped the communist party in learning the experiences of Chinese rev- olution and also to develop a strategy for India’s democratic revolution.

Telangana Struggle
The revolt started in 1946 in the Nalgonda district in Andhra Pradesh, which was then part of the princely state of Hyderabad, against the oppressive feudal lords and quickly spread to the Warangal and Bidar districts in around 4,000 villages. The revolt was also taken up by the local peasants and labourers against their landlords in their respective villages, which was also referred to as samsthans.
In 1928, the Andhra Maha Sabha was formed to bring about reforms in admin- istration, demands for more schools, concessions for the landed and civil liberties.
The Second World War resulted in the spreading of communist ideology to Andhra Maha Sabha. In 1942, with the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party of India (CPI), the communists began to grow in Hyderabad. The Communist Party of India became very strong by 1943 and it had established a stronghold over Telangana, which led to the evolution of the Andhra Maha Sabha as a radi- cal communist organisation.
These ideologies having spread across various districts amongst the peasants and small landholders conducted several struggles against their rich landlords opposing various actions like illegal taxations and forced eviction.
Visnuru Ramachandra Reddy, a landlord of Jangaon Taluk, Nalgonda, tried to forcibly seize the land of a lowly washerwoman, Ilamma, by sending goons. In July 1946, Doddi Komarayya led a march towards the landlord’s house. The goons of the landlord fired shots and killed Doddi Komarayya on the spot and injured his elder brother Doddi Malaya and two others. The angry peasants charged towards the mansion of the landlord armed with hay to burn down the mansion. It was however thwarted by the intervention of Nizam’s police. Thus, the Telangana Movement came into being as one of the largest armed peasant uprisings.
By the beginning of August, the Movement spread to hundreds of villages spread across three districts. Armed with sticks, slings and stones the sanghams organised and maintained local groups to protect the seized land and peasants from retaliation of the landlords. Several landlords abandoned their properties and fled the villages.
By the end of 1947, the communists organised village republics called gram rajyams with parallel administration across around 4,000 villages. A group of vol- unteers called dalam were organised and armed to fight against the Razakars (army of Nizam) and the police.
The entry of the Indian Army into the  state of  Hyderabad on  13th September 1948 under “police action” changed the course of the Telangana Movement. The untrained, unsophisticated and unorganised peasant army, dalams, were no match for the fifty thousand well-trained troops of the Indian Army. The dalams were decimated and were forced to retreat into the for- ests. By the end of 1950, only isolated guerilla groups existed. There was little coordination among gram rajyams, and the Movement weakened. By early 1951,
 
 
the Nehru government made several conciliatory gestures towards the CPI, and after several rounds of negotiations, the CPI formally declared the struggle withdrawn on 21st October 1951.
Post-Telangana Struggle
The experience of the Telangana Movement gave birth to three factions within the Indian Communist Movement. The first faction led by Bhalchandra Trimbak Ranadive rejected the path of the Chinese Revolution, and advocated the path of democratic and the socialist revolutions based on urban working-class mobilisa- tion. They were inspired by Joseph Stalin and viciously criticised Mao Tse Tung.
The second faction was led by Basava Punniah and P. Sundarayya of the Andhra Secretariat and leaned towards Mao Tse Tung’s ideology and method- ology. They were instrumental in taking forward the Telangana Struggle. This group while managed to taste success against the Nizam, withered against the challenge of the Government of India.
Soon after Independence the Nehru Government embarked upon the road to parliamentary democracy, bringing about land reforms like the ‘Abolition of the Zamindari system’. A third faction led by Ajoy Ghosh and Shripad Amrit Dange and S.V. Ghate formed the centrist faction of the communists. They sup- ported India during the Indo-China War of 1962. They differentiated between the Chinese and Indian conditions and followed the path of parliamentary democracy.
Partly the Indo-China War led to the split of the Communist Party of India into the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India(Marxist) in 1964. The split was more a rightist vs leftist split. The Indo-China War of 1962 created the flashpoint for the split. During the war a section of the CPI supported the Nehru Government against the Chinese aggression. The more radical wing of the CPI though opposed the Chinese aggression also opposed the CPI’s support to the Nehru Government. They accused the supporters of Nehru Government as not being leftist and called themselves conservatives or revisionists. The radi- cal wing formed the leftist faction and split from CPI and formed the CPI (M) led by P. Sundarayya, JyotiBasu, M.S. Namboodiripad and Harkishan Singh Surjeet.
The so-called leftist CPI (M) had in itself the seeds of Naxalism. Apparently, to some of the radical factions who had split from the CPI in 1964, the CPI (M) was not leftist enough. The CPI (M) formed the United Front Government in West Bengal as part of the United Front in 1967 and this was accused by the radical wing as betray- ing the communist cause and deviating from the stated objective of communism of an armed revolution. Charu Majumdar headed this radical faction that led to the Naxalbari Uprising in 1967 hoping to replicate the Communist Revolution in China.

A Violent Dawn – Emergence of Naxalism
It all started on 3rd March 1967 at a place called Naxalbari, in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, which is 6 km from Nepal and 22 km from Bangladesh, covered with thick forests and having a tribal population of around 1,26,000.
 

Naxalism derives its name from the name of a village in West Bengal called Naxalbari. They are the group of people who support the Maoist ideolog y and they were active in 10 states across India in 2009.

On 2nd March 1967, a tribal youth named Bimal Kesan went to plough his land after obtaining a court order in his favour against the landlord, Iswar Tirkey, a member of Bangla Congress. The goons of Iswar Tirkey attacked him and pre- vented him from entering the land. Bimal Kesan approached Krishak Sabha, whose leader was Khanu Sanyal, who offered to help him get his land. The peasants occupied Iswar Tirkey’s land, and he was forced to seek police action against them. Clashes followed between the police and the peasants, led by Charu Majumdar and Khanu Sanyal; the tribals and peasants started to forcefully recap- ture their lands.
Within two months, this Movement spread to West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Thus, this extremist movement came to be called “Naxalism” and the perpetra- tors “Naxalites”. The Naxalites claim to follow Mao Tse Tung’s ideology and call themselves Communist Revolutionaries. They are also called “Red Terrorists” or “Left Wing Extremists”.

Charu majumdar’s Historic Eight Documents

Charu Majumdar wrote eight articles propagating Marx–Lenin–Mao ideologies. These are considered to be the Bible of the Naxalite Movement. The eight documents are:
1.	Our tasks in the present situation.
2.	Make the people’s democratic revolution successful by fighting against revisionism.
3.	What is the source of the spontaneous revolutionary outburst in India?
4.	Carry on the struggle against modern revisionism.
5.	What possibility the year 1965 is indicating?
6.	The main task today is the struggle to build up the true revolutionary party through uncompromising struggle against revisionism.
7.	Take this opportunity.
8.	Carry forward the peasant struggle by fighting revisionism.

NAxAliSm – AN EVoluTioN
In 1967 the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries was started within the Communist Party of India by the revolutionaries from many states to bring together all the revolutionaries under one umbrella. This committee called on the revolutionaries to start a Naxalbari type of struggle by propagating the Marxism–Leninism–Maoism line of thought.
 
 
Later the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries was referred to as the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (AICCCR). They adopted two doctrines, namely,
1.	Allegiance to militant struggle
2.	Non-participation in elections
In May 1969 the AICCCR formed a new party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist). They elected Charu Majumdar as its general secretary. They indulged in armed violence in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh with an agenda to annihilate class enemies.
Soon internal conflicts began to rise and the arrest of Charu Majumdar in July 1972 led to the disintegration of the CPI (ML). In the early 1980s, several Naxalite groups emerged in various regions. The Naxalites in Andhra Pradesh emerged as the CPI-ML (Peoples’ War Group/PWG), and the Naxalites in Bihar called themselves the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC). The Peoples’ War Group emerged as the dominant group with its active presence not only in Andhra Pradesh but also in Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.
The two groups PWG and MCC carried on their activities individually with varying degrees of successes and failures. A period of lull was experienced in their activities in the 1990s largely due to strong police action. However, in September 2004 PWG and MCC came together and formed the Communist Party of India (Maoist). This has brought about a renewed spurt of violence that goes on to this day.

CAuSES for THE riSE of NAxAliSm
Any social and political movement generally comes out with an objective which is deeply embedded in the conditions of life of the people and reacts to their frustrations. These movements use development, participation and governance, which they want to be changed. The government plays a major role in being the sole authority in enacting legislations and functions as an arbitrator for resource allocation and shapes the relationship between the people and the political system. A few major factors that are the cause for rise in Naxalism are:
•	The slow implementation of land reforms is one of the major factors
responsible for the rise in Naxals.
•	Mismanagement of forests by the government since the British era is one main reason.
•	Lack of infrastructure in tribal areas has left the people with under-
development.
•	Lack of employment opportunities because of improper industrialisation has made people highly vulnerable to join the Naxals.
 
•	Social structure of the society is very poor as the people have no resources to meet their requirements, which is a cause for concern. People are socially excluded as the fruits of development do not reach them.
•	Proper education is a problem as it has not provided the ability for the peo-
ple to improve.
•	Governance has remained inconsistent in most of the regions as popular schemes have taken a longer time to formulate and a much longer time to be implemented.
•	Food insecurity is also a cause as the tribes starve to death in most of the
regions, and they borrow money from lenders for more interest.

iNiTiATiVES by iNDiViDuAl STATES
Naxalism originated in West Bengal but it has to spread to various other states where most of the tribes are concentrated and these regions are less developed. States in which Naxalism is seriously spread are Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Odisha. A few other states also include Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.
Many among these state governments have taken a number of initiatives against the Naxalists. The initiatives are:
•	To stop the Naxals from escaping the state border after an attack, the state
governments of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have decided to share information and to act against Naxals with co-operation.
•	The State Industrial Security Force (SISF) is to be set up by the state of
Jharkhand similar to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to protect and prevent the industries in the state from Naxal attacks, as the Naxals destroy machineries and the infrastructure.
•	The Odisha government has to decide to deploy 10,000 extra CRPF per-
sonnel to counter the attacks of the Naxals.
•	The Tamil Nadu government has started a 10-day guerilla warfare training to the state police in the central districts.
•	Surveying of labourers from other states is being done by the Kerala gov-
ernment as the Naxals are looking for a hideout in safe places.

rEASoN for iTS SurViVAl
The illegal mining industry in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand acts as a source of finance for the Naxal leadership and cadres. This industry being illegal does not pay taxes to the government, rather they are paid to the Naxalites. It is also believed that this is the reason why Naxalites are hell bent on thwarting the auc- tioning and leasing of mines by the government to Corporate Private Entities.
Another reason for the Naxalism’s strengthening is the inability of the state to bring about the upliftment of the deprived sections of society in the affected
 
 
areas. Social indicators such as literacy, employment, etc. of the Naxal-affected areas are the worst, going way below the national average. Ironically, the tribals and lower caste people who are the India’s poorest form the Naxals’ cadre base. The inefficient implementation of welfare policies and corruption has led to fur- ther impoverishment of the already poorest sections.
Alienation of the forest land and their corresponding land rights to the tribals owing to large-scale displacement due to construction of dams and leasing out land for mining adds fodder to the already raging fire. The alienated people bear grudges against the state and this is exploited by the Naxals to their advan- tage. This rendered the Naxalites to make inroads into several areas and states.

Ex-Prime Minister Mr. Manmohan Singh has declared the Naxalites as a serious threat to India’s security as their number in 2006 grew to over 70,000 armed cadres. “Ultras” is the word used to refer Naxalites and various government militants.
Another reason for its survival today is the lack of co-ordination between the Union and the States in their efforts of tackling Naxal violence. Law and order being a State subject and the Union’s role limited to aiding the civil power of the State, there exists a conflict as to who is more powerful. This certainly adversely affects the anti-Naxal operations in almost all states.
Inadequate land reforms have been the major reason for the starting and also the continuance of the Naxal Movement in India. Land being the state sub- ject, the Union had little to do with land reforms. The states on the other hand had made only half-hearted reforms at redistribution of land, which only helped in strengthening the Naxal cause. Very low industrialisation led to disguised employment in the agricultural sector. Lack of land reforms added fuel to the five, and many youths sought solace in the Naxal Movement either out of anger and frustration or for gain.
The Criminal Justice System in India is to slow to deliver swift and cheap justice. In contrast to this, the Naxals have been delivering justice quickly and cheaply to the poor through their Sangams and Jan Adalats (People’s Court). This has created a situation where the people are looking forward to the Naxals for jus- tice instead of the State. A sense of legitimacy has been granted to the Sangams and Jan Adalats by the people’s participation which helped in the consolidation of power of the Naxals.
The Naxals rather than presenting the larger agenda of communism to the deprived and exploited sections of the people and seeking support took up local livelihood issues dealing with people’s rights of Jal, Jangal and Jamin (water, for- est and land). They became champions of the people’s cause. This provides an emotional attachment for the people towards the cause and they readily provide support to the Naxal leaders. This local support provides intelligence, cadre base and logistics to the Naxalite Movement.
 
STrATEgy of THE NAxAlS
The Naxalites follow the strategy as propounded by Mao Tse Tung in his book Yu Chi Chan (Guerilla warfare) during the Chinese War against the Japanese. The Naxalites indulge in guerilla warfare against the Indian Forces just as China indulged against Japan. Mao in his book held that certain factors are critical for victory, viz. terrain, communications and technical support, local support to the cause, surprise attacks, cadre quality, base areas and relative military capability of the opposing side.
He also devised three stages for a Revolutionary Warfare. They are:


The Naxalite cadres begin their work in remote hilly, tribal and rural areas. This will facilitate isolation and easy access to cadres as the governments usually ignore these areas. They work invisible to the eyes of the government. It is easy for them to indoctrinate the people and recruit them. Naxal cadres live and work among the locals and socialise with the locals. Gradually they gain their trust and slowly work their way into recruiting them into the Naxal Movement. This forms the early phase of Stage 1.
 
 
The second stage involves armed guerilla warfare. This kind of guerilla war- fare is to have maximum impact on the morale, motivation and psychology of the Indian forces than gaining a territorial control like a conventional war. They are carefully planned and executed with precision. This warfare is of low intensity and usually the targets such as high-profile individuals like police chiefs, politi- cal leaders, community leaders, Panchayat leaders or from government estab- lishments such as Panchayat offices, Police Stations, Jails and Prisons, District magistrate offices, etc. are specifically picked. Ambushing, kidnapping, robbery, dacoity and assassination are the means adopted by the Naxalites as part of the warfare.
The third stage involves military objectives and conventional warfare. Slowly arms and ammunitions are gathered by attacking and robbing police sta- tions, arms depots, etc. Enough finances are mobilised and popular support is consolidated. Finally, a regular Army is established and combat operations are undertaken. Government forces are met in conventional battles to get territorial control. The end of Stage 3 will be the annihilation of the class enemies replacing the existing old order with a new order ruled by the working class.
There is no fixed and predictable timeline for the movement to move from stage to stage. Currently, the Naxal Movement is in Stage 2. Given the strength of the Indian Armed Forces and the nature of transition being brought by the welfare policies of the government, the Naxal Movement to move to Stage 3 might take ages or might never see the light of day.

rECruiTmENT ProCESS of THE NAxAlS
The ideology of Naxalists is to seek local support voluntarily. Initially Naxal recruitment too was based on voluntary basis only. However, as times passed they indulged in forcible recruitment out of desperation. It was no different from any other global terrorist organisations like the LTTE or Taliban or ISIS. They forcibly recruit youngsters, women and children. They had a policy of compul- sory conscription of one member of the adivasi family for the Naxal cadre. If no male member was available, female members of the family were forced to join as cadres. This ugly face of Naxalism brought them in conflict with the tribals as they went against their customs. In 1992–93, once such conflict in Chhattisgarh ended with the Naxalites killing 70 adivasis. In an interview with Naxals at a Naxal relief camp in Chhattisgarh, it came to light that several cadres were below 16 years of age.
Though a large chunk of the cadres are tribals, dalits and peasants, the Naxals also recruit educated university students. These students by themselves indulge in rebellious activities. They engineer student movements and covert urban networks. They are the soft targets of Naxal recruitments. The strategy of recruitment also differs in accordance with the target group. When it is trib- als or dalits and illiterates, they appeal through their local problems, which are mostly related to their rights of Jal, Jangal and Jamin, social, caste and class issues.
 
They hit the emotional cord or recruit by coercion. On the other hand, with respect to educated university students they adopt the policy of political indoctri- nation as a part of the recruitment strategy.
Another strategy adopted is giving incentive for being part of the cadre. The incentives may be financial support, food rations, goods or prominent posi- tion in the Naxal structure. Naxals also play the identity card to recruit cadres. They appeal to the ethnic, tribal, caste and religious identity of the masses to recruit cadres en masse.
As part of the recruitment, the Naxal recruiters perform a background check on every potential recruit before initiating the training process. Initially, the new recruit is admitted as a member of the party and is kept under observation for varying time periods depending on the background.
•	6 months – working class, labour class or peasant class recruits.
•	1 year – middle class, petty bourgeoisie, urban middle class recruits.
•	2 years – urban intelligentsia and other recruits.
During this candidature period the new recruits are appointed under several units of the party. Various roles are allotted and the recruits are observed. After the candidature period, the party unit reviews the recruit’s performance and then decides whether to give full membership or extend the recruit’s candidature by another six months.

NAxAl TrAiNiNg AND STruCTurE
The Naxalites were trained on the lines of professional armed forces due to which they have now evolved into an efficient guerilla force.
The arrest of Misir Besra by the CRPF from the jungles of Jharkhand  in September 2007 has shed light on the training process of the Naxalites. He divulged that the Naxalites were trying to consolidate in states contiguous with  a base area in the Dandakaranya forests on the Chhattisgarh–Orissa border and that they were planning to raise new ‘’companies’’ and ‘’platoons’’ to boost their strike capabilities in eastern India.
The duration of the Naxal training is estimated to be anywhere between 3 years and 6 years. Local youths are usually preferred for training and action in an area rather than outsiders. It is due to the assumption and is partly true that the locals will have an edge over outsiders, the terrain being their backyard. It is easy to train the locals and would be highly effective during guerilla operations in the local area.
Like a conventional army, the Naxal army is divided into squads, platoons, companies and battalions with strict discipline, unidirectional chain of com- mand, rigid hierarchy and leadership. Each squad consisting of 9–10 men and 2–4 squads comprise a platoon. Each squad has a squad leader and an assistant. Each platoon, apart from having a platoon leader and an assistant also has a polit- ical propagandist who is tasked with political indoctrination of his platoon. Two to four platoons comprise a company and are under an area commander. Two to four companies comprise a battalion.
 
 
The cadres are trained in all modern weapons, which includes automatic rifles, self-loading rifles, sub-machine guns, Kalashnikovs, M-16s, gelatin sticks and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
As devised in Mao’s Stage 2 of revolutionary warfare, the source of weap- onry for the Naxalites is mainly the Indian Armed Forces. They get all their equipments by attacking and looting police stations and arms depots.
They maintain two groups for every mission, viz. the core group and the Militia. The core group consists of full-time armed members of the Naxalites, while the militia are part timers who support the core group. The militias assem- ble only for the operation when called upon and after the completion of the operation disperse and go back to their regular life as commoners.


urbAN NAxAliSm
Until recently Naxalism was associated with left-wing extremist groups that operate in jungles and treacherous terrains of rural areas. However, in 2013, the arrest of a suspected Naxal militant, working as a carpenter in Nagpur, came as a shock to police authorities. It was an eye-opener which helped them realise that Naxalite groups could also be gaining traction in urban areas.
These urban Naxals could be anybody. Usually they don the masks of writers, teachers, professors or film directors. They either act on their own or through an organisation made up of like-minded people. They make inroads into urban areas with the aim to recruit as many from the urban intelligentsia as pos- sible to propagate their Maoist agenda. It is no surprise that their operations in urban locations are very limited. But they involve strategies that help them build a strong bastion of sympathisers and volunteers in towns and cities – the most common being the creation of front organisations. Front organisations may operate under the cloak of NGOs or social-work units, which raise questions about the use of force by government machinery. When a major module of the Kerala cadre of Naxals was busted in 2015, it was found that the group was led by a well-educated engineer who had written novels on themes of Naxalism. It was found that they were planning to enter Chennai to establish their network. During the course of investigation, it was also revealed that many intellectuals in the cities had supported their cause.
In March 2017, a court in Maharashtra convicted a professor of Delhi University under charges of spreading Maoist propaganda. It was said that the professor had been working closely with Naxals to create propaganda material for circulation among urban centres. When professors glorify about the impor- tance of Naxals in eradicating poverty, they set a very dangerous precedent.
Through their active propaganda, front organisations romanticise Naxal attacks and raise funds, create safe houses for militants, provide legal assistance to arrested cadres and conduct mass agitations against government moves that curb the spread of Naxalism. While their rural comrades keep destabilising gov- ernance in villages, front organisations promote the cause of Naxalism among urban people.

•	The paramilitary posses are in the forefront of attack by the Maoist militants, many of them were killed in typical ambushes. On 6th April 2010 Naxalites killed 76 security personnel, which was the worst attack ever. This attack was launched by about 1,000 Naxalites.
•	On 11th March 2014, Naxalites in Chhattisgarh ambushed the security team and
killed 15 police personnel, 11 of when were CRPF jawans.
•	In 2013 Naxals attacked Congress workers in Dharba valley, Odisha killing nearly 30 people.
•	In 2012, Alex Paul Menon, a collector in Sukma district, Chhattisgarh, was taken
hostage for 13 days demanding the release of the convicted Naxals; he was later released.

THE goVErNmENT of iNDiA’S APProACH
The government of India takes a holistic approach to deal with left-wing extrem- ism (LWE) in a holistic manner, in the areas of security, development, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities, improvement in governance and public perception management. In dealing with this decade-old problem, it has been felt appropriate, after various high-level deliberations and interactions with the state governments concerned, that an integrated approach aimed at the rela- tively more affected areas would deliver results.
With this in view, a detailed analysis of the spread and trends in respect of LWE violence has been made, and 106 districts in 9 states have been taken up for special attention with regard to planning, implementation and monitor- ing of various interventions. However, ‘police’ and ‘public order’ being state subjects, action on maintenance of law and order lies primarily in the domain of the state governments. The central government closely monitors the sit- uation and supplements and coordinates their efforts in several ways. These include providing Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Commando Battalions for Resolute Action (CoBRA); sanction of India Reserve (IR) bat- talions; setting up of Counter Insurgency and Anti-terrorism (CIAT) schools; modernisation and upgradation of the state police and their intelligence apparatus under the Scheme for Modernization of State Police Forces (MPF scheme); reimbursement of security-related expenditure under the Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme; filling up critical infrastructure gaps under the Special Infrastructure Scheme (SIS) in LWE-affected states; providing heli- copters for anti-Naxal operations; assistance in training of state police through the Ministry of Defence, the Central Police Organisations and the Bureau of Police Research and Development; sharing of intelligence; facilitating interstate coordination; assistance in community policing and civic action programmes etc. The underlying philosophy is to enhance the capacity of the state govern- ments to tackle the Maoist menace in a concerted manner. The division also monitors the implementation of the Integrated Action Plan for LWE-affected districts (now called Additional Central Assistance to LWE-affected districts) and various other development and infrastructure initiatives of the govern- ment of India.

goVErNmENT rESPoNSE
•	Anti-Naxal operations
Anti-Naxal operations involve the location, isolation and elimination of threat.
Location involves detecting the whereabouts of the Naxalites’ base areas through intelligence and reconnaissance.
 
Isolation involves separation of the Naxalites from their support base which involves winning over, resettlement and migration of local masses.
Elimination involves several methods of neutralising the Naxal threat. This means depending on the situation and operational flexibility of the forces. If they are beat year an armed struggle, force must be met with force. Many armed men here have lost their lives in the fight against Maoist insurgents.
•	Surrender policies
The States have brought out surrender policies for those Naxals who are willing to lay down their arms. The Jharkhand government has offered a sum of Rs 50,000 to Naxalites who surrender themselves with a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 and also an acre of agricultural land, and other educational and health benefits to their children. Similarly, the Chhattisgarh government has also offered up to Rs 3 lakh to all those who surrender their weapons.
The downside, however, has been that there is no mechanism to identify whether the so-called surrendered people are truly Naxal cadres. Also there have been cases where youths who surrender joined the Naxal Movement only to make the most of the sops offered by the government as a part of the surrender policies.
•	Socio-economic measures
The government has brought out several policies for the upliftment of the Naxalite-affected areas so as to wean the youths away from taking arms.  A few among the various schemes include the Backward Regions Grant Fund, MGNREGA, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, etc.
The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) which recognises the right of self-governance of the tribals, has been implemented by the government as a measure to tackle the Naxal problem. The tribal areas of the Naxal-affected states come under its ambit.
In 2009, an Integrated Action Plan was announced by the Government  of India for its operations that deal with the Naxalite problems across the country.

About the Division
The LWE division was created in 2006 under the Ministry of Home Affairs to effectively address the insurgency in a holistic manner. The division is respon- sible for the following roles and functions:
•	Deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) in LWE-affected states.
•	Reimbursing security-related expenditure incurred by LWE-affected states under the Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme.
 
 
•	Monitoring the progress in regard to assistance to state governments to upgrade their special forces under the Scheme for Special Infrastructure (SIS) in LWE-affected states.
•	Providing assistance to state governments for construction/strength- ening of fortified police stations under the Scheme for Construction/ Strengthening of 400 Fortified Police Stations in LWE-affected districts.
•	Providing funds to the CAPFs for Civic Action Programme in LWE- affected areas.
•	Reviewing the security situation in the LWE-affected states and issuing advisories and alerts to the state governments concerned.
•	Providing assistance to state governments for creation of operational infra- structure and logistics required to combat LWE.
•	Media and public perception management.
•	Coordinating implementation of LWE-related schemes of other cen- tral ministries, including the Integrated Action Plan (now renamed as Additional Central Assistance) for 88 Districts and Road Requirement Plan for 34 Districts.
•	Coordinating implementation of various development schemes, flagship programmes and distribution of titles under the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, in LWE-affected states.

rEViEW AND moNiToriNg mECHANiSmS
A number of review and monitoring mechanisms have been established by the government of India in this regard. They include the following.
•	MHA is monitoring the situation on a regular basis at various levels. HM convened a meeting of the chief ministers of Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra and Jharkhand on 9 February 2015 to review the 3 worst affected districts of Sukma, Bijapur and Dantewada of Chhattisgarh. HM visited Chhattisgarh from 30 to 31 May 2015. Meetings are taken periodically by HS with state chief secretaries, DsGP and the Union Ministries/Departments, DIB, DGs of the CAPFs etc. on critical issues in order to get better operational results and to speed up the develop- ment process.
•	A standing committee of chief ministers of the LWE-affected states under
the chairmanship of the Union Home Minister to work out a coordinated policy and specific measures to deal with the LWE problem on the political, security and development fronts.
•	Review Group (earlier called the Task Force) under the cabinet secretary
to review coordinated efforts across a range of development and security measures.
•	An empowered group of officers headed by the Member-Secretary Niti
Aayog (formerly Planning Commission), with officers from Development
 
Ministries and the Planning Commission, to oversee effective implementa- tion of development schemes in LWE-affected states.
•	An empowered committee under AS (LWE) was constituted on 26 May
2015 to review the progress of various developmental schemes/projects, with the JS (LWE) and the JS of the concerned ministries.


oTHEr iNiTiATiVES
In order to holistically address the LWE problem, the government has formu- lated the National Policy and Action Plan, adopting a four-pronged strategy in the areas of security, development, ensuring rights and entitlement of local com- munities and management of public perception. The focus of  the government is to address security, development and governance deficits in 106 LWE districts especially the 35 most affected LWE districts spread across 7 states.
Revival of Additional Central Assistance: This has been discontinued since financial year (FY) 2015–16; the issue of revival of IAP was taken up with Department of Expenditure (DoE) for LWE areas. A 3-year DPR-based pro- gramme is proposed for 35 most affected LWE districts. Budgetary funding will be given at the rate of ` 1,000 crore per year through special assistance under Demand No. 37. A one-time assistance of ` 1,000 crore for 35 most affected LWE districts has been decided by NITI Aayog (BE 2015–16 under Demand No. 37).
GIS Mapping: LWE division initiated a new proposal of GIS mapping of the essential services in the 35 most affected LWE districts. A project has been initiated for mapping of financial services, school, post offices, health facilities, mobile towers, PDS services, roads, security features etc. in a time-bound man- ner. This will help the stakeholder take informed decisions on developmental and security-related issues.
Mobile Towers: 175 additional mobile towers are proposed to be con- structed in the next phase to increase mobile connectivity in the LWE areas. More than 932 mobile towers have been put on air from January 2015 to December 2015 in the first phase.
A unified command has been set up in the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. The unified command has officers from the security establishment, besides civilian officers representing the civil administra- tion, and it will carry out carefully planned counter LWE measures.
Scheme of Fortified Police Stations: The ministry has sanctioned 400 police stations in 10 LWE-affected states at a unit cost of ` 2 crore under this scheme. A total of 282 of PSs have been completed; work at 118 PSs is under progress.
Civic Action Programme (CAP): This scheme was under implementation from 2010 to 11, in LWE-affected areas. Under this scheme, funds are provided to the CAPFs (CRPF, BSF, ITBP and SSB) at the rate of ` 3 lakh per company per year for conducting welfare activities in their deployment areas in LWE- affected states. This is a very successful scheme to bridge the gap between the
 
 
security forces and the local populace and also helpful for winning the hearts and minds of the populace. In this context, funds of ` 17.65 crore and ` 19.02 crore were released to the CAPFs during the FY 2014–15 and 2015–16, respectively. For the FY 2016–17, an amount of ` 19.00 crore has been allocated as BE. The entire amount has been released to the CAPFs.

In December 2011, it was reported by the Central Government that deaths caused by Naxalites had gone down to nearly 50% from the 2010 level, but this trend was offset by subsequent incidents of violence. In fact, the area of influence of LWE has extended to nearly 203 districts in 14 states. The number of armed guerillas have must sophisticated weapons, and have upgraded their tactics and field crafts. They raise funds to the tune of Rs 1,200 every year.

Andhra Pradesh model
The most successful model of response to Naxalism has been the Andhra Pradesh Model. In the late 1990s, the Naxalite movements in the Northern Telangana districts were on the brink of moving to the strategic offensive phase of Stage 2. The Southern Telangana districts were in the preparatory phase of Stage 1 of establishing a guerilla zone. A similar situation existed in the Nallamala forest and the north coastal districts bordering Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Andhra Pradesh was on the verge of becoming an area of revolutionary warfare in India. Given the situation, the government was forced to launch a strong offensive action against the impending doom. It came in the form of Grey Hounds, an elite commando force raised to exclusively deal with the Naxal issue and put an end to it. It succeeded in curtailing the Naxal activity and almost all the leaders were either killed or arrested and whoever were left fled to other neighbouring states.
The Andhra Pradesh government suitably supported the Grey Hounds by using local vigilante groups against the attempts of the Naxalites to mobilise the locals. The Grey Hounds also effectively used the surrendered Naxals in weeding out the remaining Naxals. Effective policies with a sophisticated intelligence net- work helped the Grey Hounds, the local police and the central forces in launch- ing co-ordinated efforts for the sustainable elimination of the Naxal threat.
The success of Andhra Pradesh has been not only due to the use of force in the form of Grey Hounds but also due to developmental schemes launched by the government such as Janma Bhoomi, Joint Forest Management, which enabled the people to exercise their right in the forests.

4.1
 
IntroductIon
The northeastern region of India generally comprises the following states:
•	Arunachal Pradesh
•	Assam
•	Manipur
•	Meghalaya
•	Mizoram
•	Nagaland
•	Tripura
•	Sikkim
•	Some parts of north Bengal
The first seven states amongst these are collectively called The Seven Sisters, which is a sobriquet created by Jyoti Prasad Saikia, a journalist from Tripura.  A narrow chicken neck of about 21–40 km, sandwiched between Bhutan and Bangladesh, called Siliguri Corridor, connects the Seven Sisters to central India. India shares its boundary in the northeast with China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The language spoken by the people of this region is mostly of Tibeto-Burman origin. The northeast region with a predominant tribal popula- tion has great ethnic diversity and varied religion within this tribal population.

HIstorIcal Background
Political Integration
There were only three states at the time of independence covering the entire region. The three states were the princely states of Tripura and Manipur, and other regions came under the larger Assam province that was under the British rule. The other states got identification after a few initial struggles and were divided on the basis of linguistic and ethnic lines.
•	Nagaland – the state was created from Assam in 1963 in recognition of the
Naga statehood movement.
•	Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya – these states were created out of the state of Assam in 1972. Manipur and Tripura were formerly union territories, and Meghalaya was a fraction of Assam.
•	Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh – In 1972, they were initially formed as
union territories from Assam and were granted statehood in 1987. The Mizo National Accord was signed to conclude the insurgency which paved way for the Mizoram state.
•	Sikkim – At the time of independence in 1947, Sikkim became a protector-
ate. Popular sentiment was heeded, and Sikkim was granted a full-fledged Indian statehood by the 36th Constitutional Amendment Act.
Arunachal Pradesh, known as the northeast frontier agency before indepen- dence, was separated from China by the McMahon Line. The Chinese stake their
 
 
claim to this territory, and in 1963 this resulted in an unprovoked escalation of skirmish by the Chinese side which overran the entire region. Still the issue was not solved making the India–China border, a disputed territory.
As most of the states in the northeastern region remained independent during the British Raj their affinity towards an integrated India is still an issue. Although the northeastern states are now politically integrated to central India, the psychological integration to the idea of India is yet to be a reality due to the mindset of a section of the population.

geograPHy
Climate: the northeastern region predominantly has a humid sub-tropical climate with hot and humid summers, heavy monsoon and moderate winter. It generally has a pleasant climate with mild and heavy showers.
Forests: northeastern India with predominant rainforests has a variety of flora and fauna and has the last remaining rainforests in the Indian subconti- nent. The region was described as seven most biodiverse regions of the world by Normay Myers (2000).
Languages spoken:
•	Assam – Assamese and Bengali
•	Tripura – Bengali
•	Others – Tibeto-Burman and Austro-Asiatic tribal languages
Religion: Hinduism, Christianity and several tribal religions. The minority is the Muslim population in Assam.
Resources: tea-based industries, petroleum and crude oil, silk, timber, forest resources and tribal handicrafts.
Natural endowments: evergreen forests, one-horned rhinoceros, elephants, other endangered species and several variety of endemic flora.

InterdePendence
To bring in co-operation, and in order to sort the issues between these seven northeastern states, in 1971, the government of India created the northeastern council. The states were represented in the council by the Governor and the Chief Minister.
The interdependency of the northeastern states has increased as they are connected to the mainland only through a narrow corridor. There has to be mutual co-operation between them because for the movement of any raw materi- als or goods to the six states of northeastern India, it has to move through Assam as Assam connects all the other six states. Hence, Assam is considered to be the gateway of northeast and their co-operation is essential for the survival. Mutual co-operation is also needed in the proper management and use of the interstate rivers as river Brahmaputra flows from Arunachal Pradesh to Assam and other small rivers which originate in Nagaland, and Manipur flowing though the other
 
state boundaries. There are ethnic, religious, linguistic and tribal ties which extend these river border markings. Mutual co-operation and understanding is needed among the people of the same state as one can see diversity in all forms even within the state.

PolItIcal unrest
Insurgency in the northeast
A large number of ethnic groups are involved in insurgency in the northeast region with their own set of demands. Some call for a separate state, some ask for greater autonomy within the state and few others demand for complete inde- pendence. Most of the insurgent groups are armed and based on ethnic and lin- guistic lines as the region is home to diverse tribal population.
It is true that the northeast has been isolated since the British Raj. It is con- nected to India only through a narrow Siliguri corridor, which is completely sur- rounded by sovereign countries like Bangladesh, China, Myanmar and Bhutan. With only 3.8% of the population of India, it has a very small representation in the parliament, and all these have created a sense of alienation in the mindset of the northeast people.
Northeast has a variety of ethnic and linguistic groups who are now actively engaged in the self-preservation of their culture and tradition. Some of these strug- gles have turned violent with groups like the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) and NLFT involving in anti-state activities. After the Sino-Indian war in 1963 and the rise of violent insurgent groups, the security components on the policy matters concerning northeast have increased.
Growth and development are difficult to reach the northeastern region because of its isolation from the mainland India. Earlier policy makers were unconvinced about the northeast enjoying the fruits of development in the rest of India. But in the globalised environment, which creates boundaryless states, global villages, growth and development are bound to reach this region. As the northeast region is surrounded by many independent countries, it could act as the gateway to the southeast Asian market, and India could economically integrate the northeast to the south Asian market. This will bring in economic growth which will in turn bring in employment opportunities to the youth in productive occupation and will derive various other benefits to these people.
As per the ‘Look east’ policy of the government of India, the northeast region will act as the nodal point, and as a gateway to the East Asian and Southeast Asian region. With India’s active participation in international organisations like ASEAN, BIMSTEC, Mekong–Ganga cooperation, etc. the northeast region has become an integral part both to the economic and security policy of the country. Internal tension exists between centre and state, between two or more states, and also between various tribal communities within the state. The tension also arises due to settling of the illegal migrants from Bangladesh into India. The
 
 
people in the northeast blame the Indian government for not taking adequate steps to address their concerns and stake claim for more autonomy and greater participation in the governance process. A few examples of internal tensions are the interstate disputes between Manipur and Nagaland because of the demand of Independent nation by Nagas, which includes the territories of Manipur and other states. The insurgent groups in other northeastern states like Assam, Mizoram and Tripura demand independent status or greater regional autonomy.
At present, these tensions have considerably eased due to continuous efforts of both centre and the state governments. Insurgency in Mizoram was completely subsided; the Indian government has made a number of cease- fire agreements with various insurgent groups and recently signed a historical accord with Nationalist Socialist Council Nagaland – NSCN (IM) to end the Naga insurgency. But still insurgency does continue to thrive in various pockets of the state.


 
assam
History
The origin of the word Assam has been traced back to the Shan invaders of the 13th century. The Shan invaders were also called Ahoms, which is believed to be a derivative of the word Acham, which means undefeated or conquerors. The land of the Ahoms thus came to be called Asama, which is the Sanskritised form of Acham. Asama in Sanskrit means peerless or unparalleled. Assam is nothing but the anglicised form of Asama. The varied races of Austric, Mongolian, Dravidian and Aryan origin, who invaded this land, have contributed to its composite cul- ture. Thus, Assam has a rich and varied legacy of culture and civilsation.
Assam was initially inhabited by the Kiratas, the Cinas and some primi- tive tribes collectively referred to as the Asuras. Kirata in the present context comprises several races that exhibit Mongoloid features. The evidence of Indo- Chinese invasions can be assumed by the various people in the region speaking Tibeto-Burman languages. The Bodo tribe forms the most important group of this race. They faced the assault of both the Ahoms and the Aryans and finally in the 13th century, the Ahoms established their control over Assam finally emboss- ing their name to the territory. Then the Ahoms were defeated by the Burmese who entered through the eastern borders. In 1826 Assam became a British pro- tectorate by the Yandabo treaty between Burma and Britain.

location
Assam is the sentry to northeast India and serves as a gateway to enter the north- eastern states. The state forms India’s boundary with Bangladesh and Bhutan.
History
ULFA, in 1979, was formed at the backdrop of the All Assam Student Organisation’s agitation against all foreigners. The important leaders, who were instrumental in the creation of ULFA, are Arabinda Rajkhowa, Pradip Gogoi, Paresh Baruah, Anup Chetia and Bhadreshwar Gohain with an aim to create a socialist and independent Assam through armed struggle.
It established relationships with groups like the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) of Burma and NSCN of Nagaland to acquire arms and training for the new recruits. It raises fund by forcefully extorting it from the people. ULFA has been banned by the government of India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967 as a terrorist organsation.
ULFA’s aggression increased after the 1990s and since then it has targeted security personnel, political opponents and the state’s infrastructure.

ulFa
The ULFA is a separatist group whose stated objective is to create indepen- dent Assam through armed struggle. The government of India has notified it
 
as a terrorist organisation and banned the organisation since 1990. Rang Ghar, a historic site related with the Ahom kingdom is identified as the place where ULFA originated in the year 1979. It seeks to bring back the glorious times of the Ahom kingdom and hence seeking an independent Assam. ULFA strength- ened its position by establishing links with the NSCN and the KIA in the 1980s. It carried out many violent activities during the 1990s and hence military action has been taken against this group, which continues even today. In the last two decades nearly 10,000 rebels, army personnel and civilians were killed in these clashes. In 2009, India was successful in getting the chairman of ULFA into custody.
Apart from India, Bangladesh is also cracking down on the rebels, which has aided India’s efforts to bring peace to the region. At present ULFA has diluted its stand for seeking independence, and has come forward to engage in diplomatic talks with the government of India. The Union Government, the State Government of Assam and the ULFA signed a tripartite agreement for Suspension of Operation (SOP).

ulFa’s claim
ULFA claims that Assam was never an integral part of India as the treaty of Yandaboo was signed between two occupying powers as Burma and Britain and the people of Assam were never involved.
It claims that its objective is to free Assam from the economic abuse and violence of India and establish an independent sovereign nation through armed struggle. It claims that the lack of national identity is the most basic problem of the people of Assam. It claims to accommodate all the people of Assam who want an independent nation regardless of religion, race, caste and tribe.

the government’s stand
The government of India has banned ULFA under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. A number of strategic operations have been carried out against ULFA by the Indian Army, which is still continuing its presence in Assam.
The ULFA has carried out many assassinations and bomb attacks of which the most notorious had been the assassination of Surendra Paul, the brother of businessman Swaraj Paul, which lead to the dismissal of the Assam government under Prafulla Kumar Mohanthi.
The ULFA has been accused of having links with ISI of Pakistan and DGFI of Bangladesh. Apart from these, it seems to seek shelter from China as crack- down has been heavy in both Myanmar and Bangladesh, its traditional hideouts.

negotiations
ULFA has put up three preconditions for the peace talks. They are
1.	Talks should be held in a third country.
2.	The talks should be held under the supervision of the United Nations.
 
3.	The sovereignty of Assam should be included in the agenda of talks.
ULFA gave up the first two preconditions for the talks in 2004. The govern- ment of India refused the third precondition of Assam’s sovereignty as a part  of the talk. ULFA in 2005 created a “People’s consultative group” which is an 11-member civilian group to negotiate on its behalf with the government of India; this was welcomed by the government, and talks were carried out. The group was headed by noted writer Indira Goswami, and these talks led to a tem- porary truce in 2006.
The following are the four contentious issues in the talks:
•	Economic under-development in Assam
•	Illegal immigrants from Bangladesh
•	Equitable sharing of revenue from Assam’s important resource – tea and oil
•	Massive unemployment
The success of the talks involves in making the ULFA leaders take up respon- sible positions in the society, either in the government or in civil society. Armed cadres of the ULFA need proper rehabilitation.

Present situation
The ULFA, the centre and the state government signed a tripartite agreement for the suspension of operations (SOP) of ULFA in 2011.
However, their commitment towards peace will ensure the success of the agreement. It should involve the representatives of the local community, informed civil society members along with the government representatives to bring in diversity and voice from the grassroot level. Such groups when involved can successfully prevent, manage and end the conflict. Moreover such action will get the support of the people, and hence increase the sustainability of the outcome.
Bipartite talks are important instruments in bringing together the parties to obtaining peace. The government needs to counter the ideology of ULFA as it enjoys the support of the people. Civil society in Assam is pushing the govern- ment to conduct talks with the group so that the armed insurgency in the state is brought to an end. Moreover the constitutional setup in India helps such groups to enter the democratic process after giving up their armed struggle. The best example is the Mizo National Front, which ended its insurgency and got absorbed into the democratic process and the national main stream.
At present ULFA is divided into two factions:
1.	ULFA-PTF: ULFA Pro Talk Faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa.
2.	ULFA-ATF: ULFA Anti Talk Faction led by Paresh Baruah.
The ULFA-PTF is engaged in peace talks with the government and has signed the suspension of operations. The second anti-talk faction renamed itself as ULFA-Independent (ULFA-I) and is continuing the activities of the previous united ULFA. It has established links with other insurgency groups and is actively
 
supported by ISI of Pakistan. This faction continues with its violent activities today. The Union Home Minister stated in 2015 that Mizoram, Tripura, a large part of Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh are almost free of insurgency.
ndFB
National Democratic Front of Bodoland, also called Bodo security force is a terrorist organisation working from Assam, which seeks to create a sovereign Bodoland territory for the Bodo people. Ranjan Daimary is the founder of NDFB who was arrested and detained by the government. NDFB though claim to represent the Bodo people, in reality represent the Christian minority and not the indigenous Bodos. NDFB was established as the Bodo Security Force in 1986 and later rechristened as NDFB in 1994.
The aim of NDFB is to create a sovereign Bodo territory in the area that lies north of the Brahmaputra river. Along with the NSCN (IM), NDFB has training camps in the south Bhutan region. The Indian army with the help of Bhutan has launched many operations to destroy these camps. The main objec- tives of NDFB as listed in its own constitution, which was adopted in 1998, are:
•	India’s occupation and expansionism should be removed from the Bodo
territory.
•	Colonialists who dominate, oppress and exploit the Bodo people should be removed.
•	To uphold the integrity of the sovereign Bodoland territory.
•	To set up a democratic socialistic society that promotes the ideas of liberty, equality and fraternity.
•	To use Roman script in the language.
•	To participate either indirectly or directly in the elections to the Lok Sabha.
ceasefire
NDFB unilaterally announced ceasefire in 2004, where the Indian government paying no heed to it launched operations against the group. Later in 2005, a ceasefire agreement was signed between NDFB and the government of India. Both the sides agreed to stop the aggression against each other. The agreement prevented NDFB from assisting other rebel groups and also disarming members and were made to live under army supervision for a year. The ceasefire agree- ment is extended periodically and the peace talks have still not begun between NDFB and the government.

arunacHal PradesH
History
Arunachal Pradesh was earlier known as the North-East Frontier Agency under British India. Only in 1972, upon conferring the union territory status, was it
 
 
christened Arunachal Pradesh. It attained statehood status in 1987 and was divided into 19 districts with Itanagar as its capital.
It is the northeastern-most state and forms the farthest frontier with China. Itanagar in Papum Pare district is the capital of the state. Arunachal Pradesh is referred to as Prabhu mountains in the Kalika Purana and Mahabharata.

the mcmahon line
In 1914, the Shimla Accord was signed between China, British India and Tibet. The objective of the Shimla Accord was to define a boundary line between the inner and outer Tibet and between outer Tibet and British India. Sir Henry McMahon drew a boundary line between outer Tibet and British India and hence the name. The Tibetan and British representatives agreed to this boundary that ceded Tawang to British India which is a boundary line between outer Tibet and British Raj, while Chinese representatives also agreed to it. The Chinese repre- sentatives disagreed on the boundary agreement of inner and outer Tibet. But Tibet and Britain went ahead and agreed upon the accord, and the Chinese rep- resentatives stated that Tibet was not independent and any such accord without Chinese assent was invalid.
Only after two decades in 1938, the British government published maps showing Tawang to be part of the North-East Frontier Agency. In late 1947, Tibet retracted its position and claimed territory to the south of the agreed boundary.
In 1950 India unilaterally declared the McMahon Line to be the bound- ary in the NEFA sector and vacated the rest of the Tibetan administration from Tawang. People’s Republic of China never accepted the boundary and claims Tawang to be a part of Tibet on behalf of the Tibetans.
This created a war-like situation in 1962, when People’s Republic of China overran NEFA. Most of the areas in Arunachal Pradesh were captured, and China declared itself victorious and voluntarily withdrew back to the McMahon Line. Thus, the border is still a disputed area between China and India, and the people of Arunachal are being issued stapled visas by the Chinese.

Insurgency
The Arunachal Dragon Force was the only isolated incidence of insurgent move- ment in Arunachal Pradesh, which arose in 2001 as the East India Liberation Front (EALF). Indigenous insurgent movements in Arunachal Pradesh are insignificant and have a very small support base. Most of the violent activities in Arunachal Pradesh are caused by groups that belong to and operate from other states. For example, insurgent groups like NSCN (IM) and NSCN (K) groups, which have their base in Nagaland, train their cadres in the districts of Changlang, Tirap, which is in the southwestern part of Arunachal Pradesh. Moreover, this region has faced the turf wars between the two factions of the Naga insurgency movement, NSCN-IM and NSCN-K.
 
Few other groups that operate from Assam and Manipur use the terri- tory to traffic arms and ammunitions from neighbouring countries especially Myanmar. Bodo insurgents from Assam have used Arunachal as their safe havens and have crossed borders into Myanmar to escape from the Indian armed forces.
The situation has not been resolved despite directions from the Supreme Court. A commission was appointed by the Supreme Court in 2006 to demarcate the boundaries between Nagaland, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

megHalaya
History
Under the Assam Reorganisation (Meghalaya) Act of 1969, an autonomous state called Meghalaya was established within Assam. Meghalaya was granted state- hood in 1972 with its own legislative assembly. It is bound on the north and east by Assam and on the south and west by Bangladesh. Meghalaya meaning ‘the Abode of Clouds’ is a hilly state and is inhabited by the tribal population of Khasi, Jaintia and Garo.

Insurgency groups
Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA)
The GNLA, formed in 2009, carried out violent attacks, extortions, etc. against the armed forces with an objective of creating a sovereign Garoland that includes the western region of Meghalaya. GNLA operates from Bangladesh with the support of various insurgent groups like ULFA and NDFB of Assam and NSCN-IM of Nagaland.
Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC)
HNLC is an insurgent organisation of Meghalaya, which claims to represent the aspirations of the Khasi and Jaintia tribal people of liberating Meghalaya from the Garos and other non-tribal outsiders. It strongly believes that the Khasi youth are alienated from development because of the presence of Garo and oth- ers in Meghalaya.
The erstwhile Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council (HALC), the first militant organisation in Meghalaya, was split in 1992 into various groups over tribal differences. One such new organisation is the HNLC and the Achik Matgrik Liberation Army (AMLA), which is formed by Garo tribes.
It has links with the NSCN-IM, ULFA, NDFB and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT). With active connivance of ISI in Pakistan, HNLC indulges in the circulation of fake Indian currency notes.
Liberation of Achik Elite Force (LAEF)
It is a Garo militant outfit formed in 2005 with an objective to free the state from the domination of Khasis and Jaintias, thus creating a separate state for the Garos
 
 
so that they could enjoy the fruits of development in the state. This group has estab- lished linkages with both the terror groups NSCN-IM and NSCN-K of Nagaland.
People’s Liberation Front of Meghalaya
It is relatively a new terrorist outfit that operates from the Garo hills and is now called the Achik National Council (ANC). The objective of the ANC is to create a separate state for the Garos so that economic development reaches the people. It supports economic opportunities and educational development of the Garos. This group maintains close contact with the Achik National Volunteer Council.
Other terrorist/insurgent groups in Meghalaya are:
(i)	Active terrorist/insurgent groups
•	Achik National Volunteer Council (ANVC)
•	Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC)
•	People’s Liberation Front of Meghalaya (PLF-M)

mIzoram
History
Mizoram, a mountainous region, was granted statehood in 1987. It was a part of Assam till it became a Union Territory in 1972. Initially under British India, the Lushai Hills remained as a part of Assam, while the remaining territory was a part of Bengal.
In 1898 both these parts were merged as Lushai Hills District and placed under the control of the Chief Commissioner of Assam. With the implementa- tion of the North-Eastern Reorganisation Act in 1972, Mizoram became a union territory and is a sequel to the signing of the historic memorandum of settlement between the government and the MNF Mizo National Front in 1986. Mizoram occupies an area of great strategic importance in the northeastern region sharing international borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is known for its richness in flora and fauna and picturesque landscape.
One can see visible shades of British influence in their culture. The Mizo language has no indigenous script; rather it uses the Roman script introduced by the Christian missionaries.
Independence movement and formation of Mizoram
After independence, this region suffered a lack of development, and there was acute food shortage. Mizos having no satisfaction with the government’s response with the mautam famine that occurred in 1959 formed the Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF), which later dropped the word famine and formed a political
 
organisation called the Mizo National Front under the leadership of Laldenga in 1961. The goal of MNF was to create a sovereign independent Mizoram. There broke out a large-scale insurgency in 1966, and the Indian government gave a military response by using the air force for the first time against its own citizens.
Under Indira Gandhi’s leadership, Mizoram was offered union territory status, and other contentious issues were solved under Rajiv Gandhi’s leader- ship. Losing the support of Pakistan through East Bengal and the formation of Bangladesh left the leaders of the movement to realise that the only way for last- ing peace is to participate in the democratic process and to recognise the state’s legitimacy. Granting statehood to Mizoram was the basic prerequisite, and a sepa- rate Mizoram state was formed in 1987 and elections were held.

Insurgency
Hmar People’s Convention-Democracy
It is an active insurgent group and is an offshoot of Hmar’s people convention, formed in 1986, with an objective of creating an independent Hmar state, con- sisting of Hmar people living in Assam, Manipur and Mizoram. HPC-D has aligned itself with several insurgency groups in the region. It has links with the NSCN of Nagaland, which has provided arms and training and also carries out a joint operation with the Manipur-based People Liberation Army. It also has stra- tegic links with the other Mizo-based groups, the Bru National Liberation Front.
Bru National Liberation Front
It is an inactive insurgent group of the Reang community formed after the clashes between ethnic Mizos and the Reang community. Formed in 1996, its main objective was protecting the rights and dignity of the Reangs. Earlier it demanded for a separate state but now the demand has toned down to a district council, which will serve the interests of the Reang people. BNLF, having given up its armed struggle, is keen on participating in the democratic process, and is presently negotiating with the government for an effective solution to the Reang problem.
Mizoram has been peaceful in the last decade.

trIPura
History
Tripura, the third smallest state of the Indian Union, has a unique tribal culture and a fascinating folklore. The references of Tripura can be traced from ‘Rajmala’ chron- icles of the kings of Tripura and also in the Hindu epic of Mahabharatha and Puranas and stone pillar Edicts of Ashoka. The rulers of Bengal were supposed to have helped Tripura kings in the 14th century. Further, there are references of Tripura facing repeated Mughal invasions and defeating the Bengal sultans in battles.
 
 
In the 19th century, King Maharaja Bir Chandra Kishore Manikya brought in administrative reforms and changed the administrative system on the lines of the British India pattern. Finally in 1949, the state merged with the Indian Union. Though it was given a group ‘C’ state status initially, in 1972, full statehood was accorded to Tripura.
Insurgency
All Tripura Tiger force (ATTF)
In 1990, the All Tripura Tiger Force was formed from the previous All Tripura tribal force. Some of them have surrendered to the government, but the rest of the splinter forces still carry out periodic terrorist attacks. The objective of the group is the expulsion of Bengali immigrants who entered Tripura after 1956, removal of the names of the people who entered Tripura after 1956 from the electoral roll and restoration of the land to the tribals. ATTF is mainly based out of Bangladesh. It has networks with various other terrorist outfits in other states like NSCN-K, ULFA, PLA, etc. ATTF has resisted attempts towards negotiation, and peace has not yet been found.
The National Liberation Front of Tripura
This organisation has been split several times due to parochial considerations and religious issues. Moreover misappropriation by the leaders, their lavish lifestyle, etc. are also reasons behind the split in this group.
The objective of this group is to create an independent Tripura through an armed struggle, freeing the state from the control and domination of imperial- ist India. This group has linkages with various terrorist outfits like NSCN-IM, NDFB, etc. It is also known to have linkages with ISI-Pakistan and DGFI- Bangladesh. It is known to have camps in Bhutan and Myanmar.

manIPur
History
The history of Manipur goes way back to 50 B.C. and comprises territories of Nagaland, Mizoram and Assam. The Kingdom of Manipur was ruled by several kings since then until the 18th century when it came under the British Rule. In 1947, Manipur attained independence and was then merged with India in 1951. During 1950–51, an Advisory Government was introduced in 1951, which was replaced by a Territorial Council in 1957. It was later granted full statehood in the year 1972.
The Kangleipak Communist Party
This party based on communist ideology was formed in 1980. Its important aim is to preserve Meitei culture and demands an erstwhile independent Manipur. It considers that the land is occupied by India. Its aim is to create an egalitarian society to address the problems faced by the ethnic Mongoloid group of the southeast Himalayan region. Its activities are mainly concentrated in the valley regions of Manipur. It had established links with a number of valleys that oper- ate from the Manipur valley, NSCN-IM and ULFA.
Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup
It is a Meitei terrorist group formed in 1994; the name means “It is the organ- isation to save revolutionary movement in Manipur”. The main objective of this movement is to clear Manipur society of the evils plaguing it like drugs, alcohol, corruption, etc. It launched ‘Operation New Kangleipak’, which
 
 
was a campaign to rid the educational system of corruption. It has links with NSCN-IM and NSCN-K, and it has given training to the cadres and offered them shelter.
People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK)
It claims to be a genuine revolutionary party of Manipur. Its main motive is to expel the outsiders from the state. It has close linkages with NSCN-IM. It has received weapons and training from KIA based in Myanmar, and its bases are located in Bangladesh.
People’s Liberation Army
It is a Meitei organisation but claims to represent other tribal groups as well.  It aims to organise the entire northeast into a revolutionary front, and bring together all the ethnic groups under a single umbrella. Its political outfit is called the Revolutionary People’s Front. It runs a government in exile from Bangladesh, and has links with various terrorists’ outfits operating in the northeast. It has links with ISI-Pakistan, which is detrimental to the security of India.
United National Liberation Front
It is the oldest Meitei insurgent group, which seeks to create an independent and socialist Manipur. Its armed wing is called Manipur People’s Army (MPA). It maintains a close association with other insurgent groups. It has its training camps in Myanmar and Bangladesh.
People’s United Liberation Front
Its main objective is to safeguard the interests of the minority Muslim popula- tion. Apart from this, it seeks to create a Muslim state in the northeast through armed struggle with support from other Muslim fundamentalist groups. It seeks to establish a state based on Sharia. It has established linkages with ISI-Pakistan.
The terrorist organsations in Manipur are listed as follows:
1.	United National Liberation Front (UNLF)

Inner lIne PermIt
Inner Line Permit (ILP) is an official travel document issued by the government of India to grant inward travel of an Indian citizen into a protected area for a lim- ited period. Currently Indian citizens require it to enter the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram.
The document has been issued under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, and the conditions and restrictions vary from state to state. It can be issued for travel purposes only. Visitors are not allowed to buy property
 
in these states. However, there might be a different set of rules for long-term visitors, though they are not valid for central-government employees and security forces.

manIPur’s demand For IlP
For the past several months, protests are on, demanding the implementation of the ILP in the state. In 2012, the Manipur assembly passed a resolution to this effect.
The Joint Committee on Inner Line Permit System (JCILPS), the com- mon platform of civil society group in Imphal valley, is spearheading the pro-ILP movement. The state has witnessed several agitations and shutdowns in the last few years on this issue.

reason for manipur’s IlP demand
Before Manipur was united with India, it had its own regulations similar to the ILP system. However, in 1951, the then chief commissioner Himmat Singh removed the regulations and allowed the unregulated entry of outsiders.
As per the JCILPS, according to the 2011 census, the population of Manipur is a little over 27 lakh. Of this, only 17 lakh (1.7 million) are indigenous people and 10 lakh (1 million) are outsiders. Whereas, according to various reports, of about 2.7 million people in Manipur, about 700,000 are of non-Manipuri origin. Whichever is valid, it cannot be denied that the state is encountering an indis- criminate rise of non-natives. The illegal immigration from Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar has also contributed to the crisis.
The cause for concern among the native population is the competition for employment and access to resources with the non-natives. As the immigrants are primarily migrating in search of a livelihood, they are willing to work for a low pay.

nagaland
History
Nagaland was established in 1963. It is bounded on the east by Myanmar, on the north by Arunachal Pradesh, on the west by Assam and on the south by Manipur. It is predominantly mountainous with Mount Saramati as the highest peak in Nagaland.
The Nagas belong to the Indo-Mongoloid race living in Northeast India and the upper portion of West Myanmar. It is estimated that there are over 50 tribes in Nagaland of which the Angami, Ao, Chang, Khiamniungan, Kuki, Konyak, Lotha, Phom, Pochury, Rengma, Sangtam, Yimchungru and Zeliang are major tribes. The language of the Nagas differs from each tribe and even from one village to another.
In the 13th century the Nagas settled before the arrival of the Ahoms. In the 19th century the British appeared on the scene, and the area was brought
 
under British administration. After independence, in 1957, the territory was established as a centrally administered territory under the governor of Assam. Later in 1961, the territory was renamed as Nagaland and was formally given statehood in 1963.

road to statehood
To participate in World War I, the Naga people were recruited by the British, while in Europe they were forced to settle their differences and started to think of unifying various tribal groups to strive towards a common interest. The Naga nationalist movement was established in 1918, shortly after the First World War.
Several violent movements broke out since independence that demanded autonomy to the Naga people. The government used the army to suppress the violence. The Naga union territory was created in 1957 as a result of the diplo- matic talks held between the government and Naga representatives. But agitation for the demand of more powers broke out and later in 1963; an agreement was signed to grant statehood to Nagaland.
later Insurgency movement
The Naga National Council was initially a political organsation of the Naga peo- ple. Under the leadership of Angami Zepn Pizo in the 1940s, it actively cam- paigned for the cessation of the Naga territory from India.
Violence was resorted to by the Naga Nationalist Council cadres as they did not agree to that of granting statehood to Nagaland. Peace talks failed to resolve the issue. The government was forced to launch a massive counter- insurgency operation against the group. Finally, in 1975 the Shillong Accord was signed; it accepted the allegiance to the Constitution of India without any condition.
Some section of the council did not agree to the agreement and formed a separate group called the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland in 1980. The group is in turn split into two factions based on tribal differences as NSCN-Isak- Muivah and Khaplang. Both the splinter groups share the same objective estab- lishing a greater Nagalim consisting of areas inhabited by the Nagas in Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, Arunachal and Myanmar.
In 1997, a ceasefire agreement was signed between NSCN-IM and the gov- ernment and has been extending till this day. In 2001 the government also signed a ceasefire agreement with the Khaplang faction.
Even though the ceasefire agreement exists, violent attacks are still carried out, and armed forces are not able to take any action against the perpetrators of violence. Ethnic conflict in Nagaland is an ongoing battle between the ethnic Nagas and Tangkhuls.
 
Peace Process
Various associations like the Naga Hoho and Naga Mother’s Association play an active role in bringing peace to the movement. Civil society and churches also play an active role in bringing reconciliation between the warring factions. Now the people have organised a number of peace marches across the state, and these efforts by the civil society have transformed the region and brought in a settle- ment of differences between various ethnic groups. Civil society represents a wide section of the people in the grassroots and have called for peace and turn- ing such activities into better productive work.

Insurgency groups
Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland – Isak-Muivah
NSCN underwent a vertical split due to differences in agreeing to the peace pro- cess with the Indian government. It was led by Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingalang Muivah with an aim to establishing a greater Nagaland based on the Maoist ide- ology on the principle of socialism and equitable economic development to the people. It primarily consists of Tangkhul Nagas. Its major source of income is through drug trafficking and also runs a parallel government and also gets sup- ports from the ISI of Pakistan and Myanmar.

naga Peace accord
The Naga Peace Accord, a framework agreement as it has been termed, signed between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the government of India on 3 August 2015 is significant for several rea- sons. First, it shows the flexibility and realism of the NSCN (IM) in terms of the willingness to alter goals, from complete sovereignty and Greater Nagalim to acceptance of the constitutional framework albeit with a provision for the grant of greater autonomy to Naga-inhabited areas outside of Nagaland through the establishment of autonomous district councils. This indeed had been a sticking point in negotiations as Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur had categori- cally stated their opposition to any territorial division. It is pertinent to note here that a similar proposal called the ‘supra-state structure’ was offered by govern- ment of India negotiators in 2011. This involved the grant of greater autonomy for Naga areas without a territorial division of the other states involved. But opposition from Manipur Chief Minister Ibobi Singh meant that an agreement could not be signed.
Second, the signing of the accord at this moment in time discloses that the platform of social support for the NSCN (IM) comprising Naga civil-society groups are insistent on a peaceful path to conflict resolution. Since November
 
2014, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Nagaland promised a peaceful settlement with the NSCN (IM) within 18 months, Naga civil-society groups like the Forum for Naga Reconciliation, Naga Hoho, Eastern Naga Peoples’ Organisation, Naga Mothers’ Association, Naga Students’ Federation and the specific Hohos of the 14 Naga tribes have been regularly holding consul- tations with the NSCN (IM) and Government Interlocutor R. N. Ravi on arriv- ing at a settlement at the earliest. The accord arrived at now ends the ceasefire process in existence since 1997 and locks in the NSCN (IM)’s commitment to peaceful dialogue. The urgency to get a peace deal breakthrough had risen in the backdrop of the rival NSCN (K) abrogating its ceasefire with the government of India on 27 March 2015 and following it up with the June 4 ambush in Manipur that killed 20 military personnel.
Third, the leaders of the NSCN (IM), Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chisi Swu (who has been unwell for some time now) have been forthcoming since 2011 to sign a framework agreement that pledges to preserve the culture, history and traditions of the Nagas and grants greater autonomy to Naga-inhabited areas outside of Nagaland. Fourth, Modi’s own promise to resolve the Naga conflict within an 18-month time frame must have been a factor in the signing of the framework agreement.
Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland – Khaplang
The Khaplang unit of the NSCN has been on sour terms with the government of India, so much so that they have regularly kept away from the negotiation table. It is reported that the faction has been consistently moving closer to Myanmar’s Tatmadaw (Myanmar’s Army), which provides them the logistics to operate from Myanmar’s territory. It is also speculated that the faction is getting closer with separatist outfits from India’s northeastern states that have camps in the region to form a government in exile, comprising the northeast region (NER) and the Naga regions in Myanmar, with a moving capital. The close association of Tatmadaw with the faction is said to be based on the mineral-rich regions under the control of the Nagas. The exploitation of these resources for Myanmar can only be possible, when having a peaceful relationship with the insurgents.
Differences between two tribal groups of Konyaks and Tangkhuls formed the basis of split of NSCN in 1988. The Khaplang faction led by Khole Konyak and S. S. Khaplang consists of the Konyak Nagas. It has a similar aim as that of NSCN-IM to create a greater Nagalim and it also runs a government in exile called the People’s Republic of Nagaland. NSCN-K, based in Myanmar, is very active now. In the worst attack on the India Army, 18 soldiers were killed and injured in an ambush in Manipur on June 2015. The army was deployed to main- tain peace against the activities of the group.

Factors resPonsIBle For Insurgency In tHe nortHeast
The factors that are responsible for insurgency in the northeast are as follows:
•	The tribal people feel alienated and deprived.
•	People have ethnic relationships with the people of neighbouring countries like Myanmar.
•	Porous borders between India and Myanmar make it easy for the infiltra-
tion of people, difficult for security forces to prevent it.
•	Infiltration from across the border changes the demographic pattern.
•	Corruption.
•	Lack of a visionary leader to guide the tribes.
•	Lack of basic amenities makes the development tardy.
•	Easy availability of arms and ammunitions.
•	Support of political parties.
•	Condition of instability in the neighbourhood.
Countries like Pakistan offer support, shelter, arms, etc. to various insurgent groups through its ISI agencies. China also plays a role in supporting, training some insurgent groups which have communist inclination. Insurgent groups use other neighbourhood countries as their base for operation. Since the crackdown by Bhutan and Bangladesh, these groups of extremists have vacated the neigh- bouring territories.

government’s resPonse to nortHeast extremIsm
A composite strategy followed by the government includes holding talks with groups. Ceasefire agreements have been made with most of the insurgent groups, and SOP is in place in almost the entire region. The government has always pushed for talks and negotiation with various groups. The government is striving to bring in the fruits of development to the northeast region, and in this it is willing to hold talks with the groups that agree to participate in the demo- cratic process within the constitution of India.
 
The basic principles on which decisions of the government are based are as follows:
•	Special schemes are for the northeast region
•	Special package for infrastructure development
•	Proportionate and effective use of force
•	Handling of issue with the tool of negotiation and dialogue
•	Providing effective political autonomy
•	Decentralisation of power and protection of the rights of the tribes
•	Improvement of connectivity through roadways and railways in the region
•	‘Look east’ policy will ensure northeast as the gateway to east Asia
•	Generate investments by organising business summits
•	Creating awareness by conducting exhibitions and seminars

counter Insurgency – stePs BeIng taken
A multi-pronged approach is required to tackle terrorism; some of the steps are as follows:
•	Having effective communication and proper connectivity.
•	Improving the infrastructure in the northeastern region.
•	Conducting talks with the insurgent groups.
•	Coordination between the centre’s and state’s force is essential for success.
•	Tough laws and quick resolving of terrorism-related cases.
•	Effective criminal justice system.
•	Non-tolerance of violence in any form.
•	Creating greater interaction with the rest of the country for better assimilation and understanding.
•	Making the government’s presence felt.
•	Holistic and equitable development needs to happen for better socio- economic condition.
•	Decentralising power to the people and monitoring its application.
•	Improving administrative efficiency.
•	Good governance with pro-public initiatives.
•	Setting up of separate high courts in Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura.
•	Giving platform to regional aspirations.

recommendatIons oF BezBerua commIttee
Five key recommendations made by the Bezbaruah Committee on tackling dis- crimination against the community are as follows.
New law against discrimination: Either a new law should be created as directed by the High Court of Delhi, or the Indian Penal Code should be amended. The offence should be cognisable and non-bailable. The investigation of the FIR should be completed within 60 days by a special squad and inves- tigated by a police officer not below the rank of deputy SP or ACP. A special
 
prosecutor should be appointed to handle all such cases of atrocities. And the trial should be completed within 90 days.
Fast-track courts and special police squads: The Committee strongly suggests the creation of fast-track courts for handling the cases relating to the northeastern people, particularly those which are racially motivated and involving heinous crimes against northeastern women and children. Specially designated public prosecutors should be appointed for cases involving people from the northeast. They should also be properly trained and sensitised.
The committee feels that the creation of a special squad supervised by the North East Special Police Unit would go a long way in ensuring speedy justice in criminal cases. The squad could be manned by people specially selected for such purposes, and they could be specially trained and sensitised about the problems of people from the northeast.
Interventions in education: Suitable innovative ways should be devised to integrate each and every aspect of the northeast into the consciousness of people outside. The Committee recommends that when the next NCERT takes place two things should be emphasised: (i) all teacher training institutes should be advised to make their syllabus in a way that can sensitise their trainees on the North East, and (ii) universities and schools outside the northeast should make projects on the northeast a mandatory part of the course curricula.
Large migration of students for higher education in Delhi and other metros has been a prominent feature in recent times. One reason for such an exodus is the absence of institutions of excellence in the northeast. A detailed socio- economic study of the nature of student migration from the North East would be worthwhile as it will provide valuable insight for planning of higher education in the region.
Social-media outreach and legal-awareness campaigns: The com- mittee recommends legal-awareness campaigns in neighbourhoods that have a significant presence of members from the northeastern community and on intro- ducing lectures on legal rights for university students. It underlines the role of social media in improving connectivity and communication with the community. A dedicated Facebook page should be created, and nodal police officers should be in constant touch with members of the community on WhatsApp.
Bonding power of sports: The committee recommends that the ministry should take steps to hold regular national and international events in the northeast as such events will create greater harmony and better understanding. The ministry should, therefore, review the status of present facilities and make an assessment if they are suitable for such events. If not, such facilities should be created in every state of the northeast. Indigenous games of the northeast should be promoted.

develoPment oF nortHeast regIon
Development plays an important role in ensuring that the security of a state is maintained. It is when development goes haywire that the people go for agitations
 
with a view to claim what is their rightful entitlement. In this context, the NER gives a promising picture, by faring pretty well across several indices of develop- ment. These can be broadly studied under the following domains.

gross state domestic Product
All of the northeastern states put together are showing a faster growth rate, when compared to the other major states in India. This is due to their industrial and service sectors, which are progressing at a consistent pace.
•	Meghalaya, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh recorded the highest growth
rates in GSDP in 2013–14.
•	Meghalaya’s growth in GSDP of 9.7 per cent was equivalent to Bihar, which had a GSDP growth rate of 9.1 per cent.
•	Arunachal Pradesh, with a growth rate in GSDP of 8.9 per cent grew faster
than Gujarat, which reported 8.7 per cent.
* Fewer people, 12.8 million, live below the poverty line in the entire north- east than in just one large state, Karnataka, which has 12.9 million poor people.
In Mizoram, for example, the growth rate for agriculture and allied activi- ties went down from 16.4 per cent in 2010–11 to 0.07 per cent in 2013–14.

unemployment Higher in urban areas
Unemployment is a key concern in the NER. When the promising growth rates do not translate into commensurate number of jobs, it leads to youngsters turning towards unlawful means of making a living – the most prevalent being insurgency.
In the NER, it is reported that Tripura with 25.2 per cent shows the highest unemployment rate in urban areas, followed by Nagaland with 23.8 per cent.

Poverty levels
The poverty levels in some states of the NER are comparatively lower to some of the larger states. For instance, the percentage of population below the poverty line in Sikkim was 13.1 per cent in 2009–10, and it fell to 8.2 per cent in 2011–12. In comparison, poverty in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh – the larger states most successful in cutting poverty – fell from 36.7 to 31.7 per cent and 37.7 to 29.4 per cent, respectively, over the same period. Similarly, in Meghalaya, the percentage of population below the poverty line was 17.1 per cent in 2009–10 and fell to
11.9 per cent in 2011–12.
However, this upper hand of a few states cannot be considered as the case across all states of the NER. While 8.2 per cent of the population is below the poverty line in Sikkim, 36.9 per cent people live below the poverty line in Manipur. According to the National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD), although the number of people below the poverty line may be lower than the
national average, the intensity of poverty is much higher in these states.
 
transport sector
The NER contains nearly 12 per cent of the total length of national highways  in the country. Assam holds the lion’s share of 30.9 per cent of national high- ways in NER and also leads the surfaced state-highway density in the region with 42 per cent.
Given the hilly terrains and numerous rivers, building railway lines is  a tough task in the NER. Presently, the entire NER has 2,646 km of railways. Except for around 179 km, the rest is within Assam. Expanding the railway net- work will help in supplementing trade routes with neighbouring countries, like Bangladesh and Myanmar.
Even in terms of air connectivity, the NER lags behind. The 8 northeast- ern states have a total of 9 airports. Presently, 3 airports are under construc- tion at Holongi, Tezu and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which had no airports earlier.

Power Production
Thanks to the growth in the number of hydel-power projects, Sikkim is the only state in the country to be a power-surplus state. Rest of the NER states face acute power deficits. The major issues in the development of hydropower projects are delays in environment and forest clearances, land acquisition, development of infrastructure and long-term financing.

literacy
Mizoram has the highest literacy rate in the NER. It takes the third position behind Kerala and Lakshadweep at the national level. Besides, it is also the pio- neer in female literacy with 89.3 per cent of the women literate, thanks to the efforts of NGOs, church schools and village councils. Arunachal Pradesh had the lowest literacy rate among the 8 northeastern states with 65.4 per cent in 2011, the second lowest in India. About 77 per cent of Arunachal Pradesh’s population is rural, where the literacy rate is 59.9 per cent. It also has the lowest female literacy rate in the northeast: 57.7 per cent.

Infant mortality
Assam had India’s worst infant mortality rate (IMR), with 54 deaths per 1,000 live childbirths in 2013, the same as the African nation of Burundi, according to the World Bank. Insurgency-wracked Manipur – often termed a failed state – is the safest place for childbirth in India, with the country’s lowest infant mortality rate, the same as Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and equivalent to that of Oman and the Bahamas, according to the World Bank and the Indian government.
 
ease of doing  Business
The NER states have fared poorly in the ease-of-doing-business ranking list as given by the World Bank.
The ranking takes into account factors such as policies, practices or proce- dures spread across 10 reform areas spanning the life cycle of a typical business. These are mainly single-window clearance, tax reforms, labour and environment reforms, dispute resolution and construction permits.
While Tripura has moved 4 places up to 22nd position from last year’s 26th position with 16.67 points, Assam has slipped from 22nd position to 24th posi- tion with 14.29 points. The rest of the NER states, namely, Nagaland secured 26th rank, Manipur was placed 28th followed by Mizoram, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya with rankings of 29th, 30th and 31st ranks, respectively.
To address the region’s development challenges, including infrastructure, the central government created the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region in 2004. A sum of Rs. 2,362 crore was allocated to the ministry in 2015– 16 in order to address the various challenges to socio-economic development. The grants from the Centre and their share in central taxes together form 79 per cent of their total revenue, according to the Reserve Bank of India.

Role of External State and Non-State Actors in Creating Challenges
to Internal Security


learning objectives

In this chapter, you will learn about:
•	Threats from External State Actors
•	China’s Role in the Northeast
•	Threats from External Non-State Actors
•	Pirates

ThReaTs fRom exTeRnal sTaTe aCToRs
External state actors are those organisations or institutions external to the home state, established and maintained by the foreign state(s) to threaten or influence the internal security of the home state.
China and Pakistan have remained to be the major external state actors hav- ing profound influence on the internal security condition of India. The influence of other states like Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal cannot be overlooked when considering our internal security.
Threat from China
Bilateral relationships between these countries have remained as that of conflict and cooperation. Border disputes with China can be traced back to nearly half a century from the present time with the major confrontation in 1962. But at the same time China has been the largest trading partner of India with a bilateral trade value of nearly US $65.88 billion in 2013.
Looking at India’s relationship with China we need to acknowledge the exis- tence of both sides of the coin. China proves to be both an opportunity and a challenge to India.
5.1
 
China not a Threat
Considering the long-existing border dispute between India and China, it has to be noted that both the nations have largely respected the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between them though there is no clear joint demarcation on a map. Rare occasions of violations along the LAC have been largely contained by the agreed standard operating mechanism, confidence-building measures (CBMs) initiated by the nations, and status quo has been maintained. Commitment made by the nations through the 1993 border peace and tranquility agreement has been hon- ored by both.
Incidents of rare violations along the border have often been sensation- alised by the media despite the actual truth being shared by the army or ministry of defense. The governments of both the nations have always tried to maintain peace and tranquility along the border.
On the trade front China has overtaken US to be India’s largest trading partner in 2008. China acts as a supplier of cheap goods for the Indian consum- ers. But these cheap goods of China pose a serious threat to the indigenous industries.
In the international arena too China and India have shared common inter- ests and ideologies in areas like climate change, WTO negotiations, IMF reforms, etc. They cooperate with other like-minded nations through BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa) while dealing with the above issues.
A slew of initiatives have been taken by China and India along various lines like the establishment of the New Development Bank, Maritime silk route, Nalanda University, etc. To sum up India–China bilateral relationships should be focused on a more optimistic path with mutual adherence to peaceful mea- sures to resolve the conflicts and increased cooperation in areas of common interest.

China as a Threat
China’s growing geopolitical influence in the region is a major threat to India.
China has been keen on following an assertive policy in addressing the border concerns. This is evident from the May 2013 stand-off along the LAC in Ladakh and the intrusion of Chinese troops along the McMahon Line in Arunachal Pradesh. Their assertive territorial policy has remained as a major irri- tant in the peace initiatives aimed at resolving the border disputes inspite of the growing trade and economic relationships between the two countries.
Another major concern has been the Chinese government’s initiative in increasing its military capability in the Tibet region and along the borders. This move aims at achieving a permanent military advantage over India. Though India has not yet achieved parity in military capabilities along the borders, it has been able to take an assertive stand at diplomatic levels for addressing the border issues where India’s stand has always been that intrusions can never be tolerated and would evoke change in its strategic posture.
 
 
Other major areas of concern in the India–China bilateral relationship are the strategic engagement of China with Pakistan, the presence of Chinese troops in PoK, establishment of transportation and communication lines, control of Gwadhar port and free trade zone.
As a part of its major initiative to establish a Maritime Silk Route (MSR), China has been engaging with countries in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). The objective is to set up commercial and military facilities along its sea lines of com- munication (SLOC), which extends from the Chinese mainland to the Port of Sudan. This is seen as a part of its larger strategy to encircle India through its ‘string of pearls’.
India, to counter these Chinese threats, should improve its military prowess and particularly its maritime assets if it has to improve its strategic posture in the South Asian Region.

China’s Role in The noRTheasT
The NER is a geopolitically sensitive zone to India, owing to its physiography and the narrow liaison with mainland India through the Siliguri corridor. Landlocked by four different countries, the insurgency situation within the NER can be addressed effectively through support from all the bordering countries. However, the situation on ground seems far from reality. Counter-insurgency operations over the last 2 years have resulted in the recovery of dozens of rifles, pistols, grenades and other ammunition, most likely made in China. Moreover, investiga- tions by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have revealed that the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) have been in touch with Norinco, which is one of the larg- est state-owned weapons manufacturers in China.
The weapons deals are said to be executed through a transnational network. Reports suggest that a money trail exists, which leads to Chinese bank branches in Africa. The insurgents pay the money to these branches and receive their ship- ments via Bangladesh and Myanmar. To aid the shipment process, ethnic insur- gent groups in these countries such as Karen National Union (KNU), Kaichin Independence Army (KIA) and United Wa State Army (UWSA) come into the picture. These groups profit from illegal arms deals and are therefore critical to the survival of insurgent groups in NER.
At a time when India is looking forward to optimally reap the benefits of BIMSTEC and RCEP trade agreements, a stable security situation in the NER is vital. Therefore, it is imperative that India devises a two-pronged strategy of crackdown and diplomacy. For effective crackdown measures, it needs to amplify its intelligence operations, and through its diplomacy, it needs to push China into checking the prevalence of illegal trade of weapons from its own ordnance factories.
Unless these measures are effectively put to use, it will be virtually impos- sible to eliminate or mitigate the problem of insurgency.
 
Threats from Pakistan
India–Pakistan bilateral relationships have been difficult since the beginning mainly due to the difficult circumstances in which these nations were born. This has been aggravated by the ceasefire violations along the LOC (line of control)
The people in the disputed areas have been used in their operations by the Pakistan-sponsored terrorist groups. The withdrawal of the NATO and American forces from Afghan soil will only risk the increase in number of such attacks. The onus lies on India to assess the pattern of such attacks and devise an effective counter strategy.
Sub-national groups such as the ethnic/religious groups recruited by the Pakistan army within the country play a role in escalating these terror attacks to conflicts. This will lead to complete disruption of socio-cultural, political and economic foundations of our society.
These sub-groups function by religiously indoctrinating the vulnerable groups and subverting their loyalty. This polarisation of the society poses a griev- ous threat to the democracy and security of the nation in the long run.

 
ThReaTs fRom exTeRnal non-sTaTe aCToRs
Non-state actors, in the context of national security, are those organisations, which have sufficient social, political and economic power to influence the secu- rity of a nation. With globalisation and ease of connectivity, these non-state actors have transcended boundaries. Therefore, India’s foreign policy and rela- tions with other nations will have to factor in the threats posed by the NSAs. It has to be acknowledged that the non-state actors as we see today have emerged post the Cold War.
Terrorist organisations
India faces all types of terrorist threats – ethnic, religious and ideological. The foundation for the insurgent and terrorist activities in the valley was laid when Pakistan tried to capture Kashmir after independence. Secessionist groups have been attacking government institutions, symbols and officials. Innocent people have also fallen victim to these attacks and several have fled the region.
Apart from secessionist groups, Islamic fundamentalists have been involving in terrorist activities in the valley. Among them the Al Qaeda, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Taliban pose the gravest threat. Even outside the valley major attacks have been staged by these fundamentalist groups including the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament, the 1993 Mumbai serial blast, 26/11 attack, etc. The Pakistan-based LeT has been operating networks in more than 18 countries including India, the US, France, the UK, Australia and Singapore.
Other emerging insurgent groups like HUM, HUJI, and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) have also been playing a major role in influencing the peace and stability of the nation. These and many other such organisations have been banned by the Government of India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 2004.
The funds for these organisations flow from various pro-Islamist groups from around the world.

Drug Cartels
India’s proximity to the two main drug-producing areas of the world –  the golden triangle (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos) and the golden crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran) – makes it more vulnerable to drug trafficking. India is being used as a major transit route and as a destination for drugs. So it is evi- dent that the drug policies of other nations like Pakistan and Afghanistan also have an effect on India’s attempt to curb this illegal trade.
These drug traffickers have established themselves as powerful syndicates and lobbies to control drug trafficking in India from Pakistan and Dubai. They have also succeeded in recruiting uniformed personnel in aiding drug traffick- ing. This has also had a serious effect on the security of the nation as they have established links with terrorist groups, thereby acting as funding mechanisms for various terrorist groups.
 
Besides funding, the terrorist and insurgent groups that try to destabilise India have indirectly led to increased incidences of HIV infection in the border regions and northeastern parts of India. They have also been involved in money- laundering activities affecting the economy of the country.
The Military, Paramilitary, State Police, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Revenue department, Enforcement directorate, Home Ministry and External Affairs Ministry have been coordinating to curb the menace of illegal drug traf- ficking. Further, India has been coordinating with various foreign intelligence and investigating agencies to fight drug trafficking. Also in 2012 a national pol- icy on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance was enacted to ensure greater cooperation and coordination at both central and state levels.

human-trafficking Cartels
In India, human trafficking in major part involves abduction, buying and selling of women and children for prostitution, forced marriages and bonded labour. Poverty, illiteracy and unemployment are the major reasons that make people vul- nerable to human trafficking. India has been both the source and destination of human trafficking. Women and children are trafficked from Nepal and Bangladesh to be sold inside the country for prostitution. India acts as a source of cheap labour to the Middle East and other European countries. They are employed as low-skilled labourers, domestic workers and sexual exploitation. There are also instances of Sri Lankan refugees from Tamil Nadu being trafficked to Australia.
According to a 2012 report of Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, India has the largest number of child labourers (aged < 14 years). India needs to have a comprehensive approach to curb the menace of human trafficking and protect the vulnerable sections of the people including women and children.

fake Currency Rackets
Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Thailand are the main sources of Indian fake currency. They are supported by ISI to fund the terrorists and undermine the financial security of the nation.
These currency notes are usually routed via UAE, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. Since the exchange ratio for these notes is in the ratio of 2:1, the revenue obtained is high. This is used in funding terrorist activities and obtaining the services of individuals at a lower cost to itself.
The Indian government has taken a slew of measures to counter the men- ace of fake currencies. A coordinating group has been formed under the Home Ministry to coordinate the information and activities between the state forces and central agencies. Further, a special cell to counter terror funding and fake cur- rency has been formed under the National Investigating Agency.
For its part, the RBI has taken measures to improve the security features of the currency notes and increase the awareness of the people to identify fake currencies.
 
Cyber attacks
Cyber attacks not only involve the attack by cyber criminals but also includes attacks by cyber terrorists and other foreign states. In case of cyber criminals their objective is primarily to gain monetary benefits.
However, in the case of cyber terrorism, the objective is furtherance of their political or social objectives. In such cases the Web sites of important secu- rity establishments are attacked and the Web sites or the network of information may be defaced or some vital information may be stolen or compromised.
India’s abundant growth in the IT sector and its attachment with state departments make it extra vulnerable to such attacks.
maoists/naxalites
Although Maoists or Naxalites are internal non-state actors, they have strong sup- porting hands from foreign leftist organisations from Philippines, Turkey and China. These foreign elements provide them with enough logistics support to mount attacks on the government forces.

insurgents/Cross-Border ethnic Groups
India’s international land border was drawn by the British during the time of independence. They were driven by geo-political, economic and strategic con- siderations while drawing the boundaries and not by social or ethnic consider- ations. So the ethnic groups were separated across nations along the borders. This makes it difficult to identify the foreign nationals. Moreover this has led to rising tensions during internal conflicts in neighbouring countries. For instance, the Nagas located in Myanmar support the insurgency activities of the Nagas inside the country.
Another aspect is the threat faced by the Indian diaspora in foreign nations and its influence on bilateral ties. For example, the Eelam Wars led to mass exo- dus of Tamil people from Sri Lanka to Tamil Nadu. This has caused strain in the India–Sri Lanka ties. Further, it has led to rising pro-LTTE emotions in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Also the threat from the Indian diaspora towards the security of the nation cannot be neglected. The financial and political support of the Indian diaspora to the separatists like Khalistan and those from Kashmir are also notable examples. It also feared that the Indian workers in gulf countries are indoctrinated during their stay and used for terrorist activities and propaganda on their return to India. It should be observed that these groups have served as a recruiting ground for the Al Qaeda and other groups to carry out terrorist activities on
their return to Indian soil.

illegal immigrants
Illegal immigrants are those people who migrate to India without any official doc- uments for their stay. Of all, illegal immigrants from Bangladesh are the largest
 
followed by the Sikhs and Hindus from Pakistan. These illegal immigrants bring along with them ethnic troubles, insurgency, political instability and commercial problems. They increase the pressure on land, deplete the natural resources avail- able, create unemployment for the local youth, law and order problems, rising crimes, increasing prostitution, etc.

multi-national Corporations
In this globalised world, multi-national corporations are increasingly influencing the global economy and relationships between nations. Along with their benefi- cial side in bringing investments to the country they also have a profound nega- tive impact. They employ the locals for a very low wage compared to their global counterparts to reduce their economic burden. Further, they move their produc- tion units to such countries where cheap labour is available and ship the finished products. This severely affects the tax income of the government. They are also able to influence the policy decisions of the government and obtain tax conces- sions and subsidy benefits.

Civil society organisations/nGos
Increasing agitations from various NGOs and Civil Society Organisations on environmental concerns have put a pause to many hydroelectric and energy proj- ects, and projects in the field of biotechnology and mining that are undertaken by the Government of India to fulfill its energy needs.
Although all these projects have environmental concerns, it is the respon- sibility of the government to go for developmental process and also provide the necessities to its citizen. Here, the most serious concern is that these organisa- tions get funds from foreign countries to protest and other such things to stop the country’s development. To counter these things, the government has brought in the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act in 2010 to have an overview of the money flow amongst the NGOs.

PiRaTes
The other serious threat for the country’s development is piracy in the vast seas. Pirates are one of the biggest concerns for a country like India because India’s trade is highly dependent on sea routes. Anti-piracy ships are working around the waters to counter them. The International Maritime Bureau was established to report these pirate ships and their thefts. Compared to all the other sea waters, the Indian waters are quite safe, but the region of the Horn of Africa faces prob- lems with pirates.
 
 
anti-Piracy operations by the indian navy
In order to better respond to the menace of maritime piracy, the Indian Navy has been deploying its escort vessels in the Gulf of Aden on anti-piracy tasking since October 2008. These vessels escort merchant ships through the 490-nautical- mile-long Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC), and thus far 50 Indian warships have been deployed. As on 15 March 2015, the Indian Navy has safely escorted 3,075 merchant ships, and a total of 40 piracy attempts have been successfully thwarted by navy ships on patrol.

inTroduCTion
The Indian peninsula is surrounded by the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea which opened up for international sea trade from the 15th century. But the same geographical proximity to the sea has posed a threat to the national security in recent times. India has a long coastline of 7,516 km (the mainland coast- line runs for nearly 5,400 km, and the coastline of island territories of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep runs for nearly 2,200 km). The Indian coastline stud- ded with numerous creeks, coves, brooks, rivulets, backwaters, landing points, bays, streams, sandbanks, mangroves and forested land presents itself as an ideal sanctu- ary for clandestine activities.
Before analysing the various attacks through the sea in the past and the pos- sible threats in the future, and the response of the government to maritime security threat, one should know about UNCLOS – II, 1973, which defines various mari- time zones of the sea, which also confers the right of the maritime states over the different zones of the sea.


6.1
 

The various areas are:
The internal waters: This includes all water bodies and water ways extending landward from the baseline. The right of passage of foreign vessels into these waters is restricted and is subject to permission being granted by the coastal state. The coastal states have absolute jurisdiction over these waters. They can make laws regulating the use of these waters and any resources in these waters.
Territorial waters: This includes all waters extending seaward, from the base line up to 12 nautical miles (22 km). Here too the coastal state can make laws regulating the use of these waters and any resources in these waters. The right of innocent passage through these waters is granted to foreign vessels.
Contiguous zone: This includes all waters extending seaward, between 12 nautical miles (22 km) and 24 nautical miles (44 km) from the base line. The state’s jurisdiction is restricted to fields of customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. These waters are thus also referred to as customs waters.
Exclusive economic zone (EEZ): This includes all waters extending seaward, from the baseline up to 200 nautical miles (370 km). The rights to exploit all natural resources in these waters are vested solely in the coastal state.

The CoasTal seCuriTy ThreaT
The coastal security threat is not limited to the physical coastline but also extends till the EEZ. Offshore oil and gas rigs, refineries, atomic power stations, ship- yards and important cities are all located along the coast. Over 90% of India’s trade is made possible through major and non-major ports. Any threat to these installations would have devastating economic consequences. This makes these institutions highly vulnerable to attacks of terrorist and other enemy nations who seek to destabilise our country.
The last two decades have brought about a tremendous change in the per- ception of what one would call maritime security threat. From the traditional threat by state actors, the threats posed by non-state actors such as terrorists, pirates, smugglers, traffickers, etc. are on the rise and is proving to be dangerous.
In the 1993 coordinated bomb attack in Mumbai, the explosives were brought through sea into Maharashtra. In 1991, assassins of Rajiv Gandhi came from Sri Lanka via the sea. The 26/11 Mumbai attack was carried out by 10 Pakistan terrorists, who hijacked a fishing vessel MV Kuber, shot the crew and arrived in Mumbai to carry out the attacks. These and many other terror attacks have proved that threat from the sea to India’s internal security is real.
The global trade and its maritime focus have shifted from the Atlantic– Pacific to the Indo-Pacific. This has reoriented the importance of the Indian Ocean region and brought with it the threats to India’s backyard – the Indian Ocean. To this effect, India's national security construct has greatly increased its attention in the Indian ocean region.
 
 


Increased activity in the Indian Ocean region owing to growing trade in goods and resources has given rise to newer forms of maritime security challenges. India, China and other southeast Asian nations depend on crude oil and natu- ral gas imports from the West Asian nation for their energy security. All energy products are transported through sea and as such are exposed to threats from pirates. Further, Chinese advances in the Indian Ocean pose a threat particularly to India.
The Enrica Lexie incident where Italian marines were accused of shooting dead Indian fishermen mistaking them for pirates in the EEZ of India showcases new dimensions of security challenges, where the livelihood of coastal people are threatened. Similarly, the frequent incidents involving the Sri Lankan Navy and Indian fishermen also bring to light the livelihood threat of coastal people.
 
Also the intrusion of fishermen from Pakistan, Myanmar, Thailand and other nations into the EEZ of India poses challenges to coastal security. These fishermen could act as traffickers of drugs, arms and illegal migrants.

CoasTal seCuriTy sCheme
The Kargil War ignited an overwhelming public debate over the issues pertaining to the security of the nation. In response, the government constituted the Kargil Review Committee in 1999. The committee recommended that a group of min- isters be constituted with the objective to come up with an extensive security system for both land and sea. Accordingly, the group of ministers’ task force rec- ommended opening maritime police stations under the Coastal Security Scheme. Further, the jurisdiction of territorial waters was supposed to be vested with the state police, that of the EEZ with the Indian Coast Guard and beyond the EEZ with the Indian Navy.
Under the first phase of the Coastal Security Scheme, 73 marine police sta- tions, 204 interceptor boats, 97 check points and 58 outposts were established. Under the second phase of the Coastal Security Scheme, 131 marine police sta- tions, 180 boats, 60 jetties, 131 four wheelers and 242 motorcycles were established. This multi-layer coastal security apparatus with the Indian Navy, Indian Coastal Guard, State Marine Police and other sister agencies constitutes the pres-
ent set up of coastal security in India.
The Maritime Zone of India Act 1976 was enacted to provide for matters in connection with the territorial waters, continental shelf, EEZ and other maritime zones of India. The Maritime Zone of India Act 1976 was enacted to give effect to the UNCLOS – III.
The features of this Act are:
(a)	The Central Government may cause the base line.
(b)	Maritime boundaries between India and neighbouring countries are to be determined by agreement or through the point of being equidistant.
(c)	The government may decide on historic waters of India.
(d)	Defined territorial water, contiguous water and the EEZ of India and continental shelf of India.
(e)	The sovereignty of India extends to territorial water of India, the sea bed, the underlying subsoil and the airspace above.
(f)	All foreign ships shall enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters.

CoasTal seCuriTy sysTem
•	Post the 26/11 Mumbai attack, coastal security was restructured, extending the defensive line further into the sea.
•	The multi-layered system of coastal security, which previously covered
Gujarat and Maharashtra, was extended to the entire coastline.
 
 
•	The Indian Navy was made the core of the coastal security system. The complete responsibility of defence of the entire coastal and offshore areas was handed over to the Indian Navy.
•	The Indian Coast Guard (ICG), the marine police and other central and
state agencies were designated to play a supporting role to the Indian navy.
•	Naval commanders-in-chief were re-designated as the Commanders-in- chief, Coastal Defence.
•	The Director General, Coast Guard, was re-designated as Commander,
Coastal Command, and was given the responsibility of overall coordination of central and state agencies in matters of coastal security.
•	In addition to the EEZ, the Indian Coast Guard was given the responsibil-
ity of coastal security of territorial waters, which hitherto was exclusively under the marine police. The marine police are to assist the Coast Guard in territorial waters.
•	The water wing of the BSF is given the responsibility of securing the creeks
and waterways in the Gulf of Kutch, Gulf of Cambay and the Sunderbans. These areas are infamous for being the preferred locales for sheltering anti- national elements and extensive trafficking.
•	The Indian Navy established four Joint Operation Centres (JOCs) in all
naval commands. They are at Vishakhapatnam, Mumbai, Kochi and Port Blair. All the coastal security operations today are coordinated from the JOC. The marine police, Customs, Intelligence Bureau and other central and state agencies are now coupled with the JOCs. Besides JOCs, an opera- tional centre is established in every coastal district for coordinating opera- tions in their respective districts.
•	The Indian Navy created a special force called Sagar Prahari Bal or Ocean
Strike Unit to protect naval bases and other areas. It comprises 1,000 per- sonnel and 80 fast interceptor boats for patrolling.
•	The CISF which provides security for India’s major ports also participate in
coordinated joint operations. They are now being trained in seamanship to deal with any seaborne threats.
•	The International Ship and Port Facility Security-Code (ISPS-Code) com-
pliance which deals with the security of ships and port facilities is being strictly pushed onto all major ports and non-major ports. Accordingly, ports must be equipped with security system, security personnel and secu- rity equipment. Further, compliant ports must segregate fishing vessel lanes from non-merchant vessels.
•	Surveillance and intelligence gathering are the core of any security estab-
lishment to counter security threats. With respect to coastal security, an informal group comprising fishermen and trained volunteers of the coastal areas are used for surveillance and intelligence gathering. These groups are called Sagar Suraksha Dal. They monitor the coastal waters and share infor- mation of any suspicious happenings or vessels.
 
•	The Indian Navy has established the National Command Control Communication Intelligence (NC3I). It is a network that links 51 Naval and Coast Guard stations, located along the coast and on island territories. The network provides these stations coastal surveillance information obtained from various sensors such as the coastal radar chain of the Indian Coast Guard and automatic tracking systems as well as electro-optical cameras. The network rides on dedicated terrestrial data circuits as well as satellite commu- nication, which helps the stations in remote locations to be networked.
•	IMAC is the nodal centre of the National Command Control Communications
and Intelligence Network (NC3I Network).
•	It is a network that hosts the Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC). The focus is on building a National Maritime Domain Awareness (NMDA) grid via a number of organisational, operational and technologi- cal changes. The network connects 51 radar stations (20 Indian Navy and 31 Coast Guard) located along the coast and on the island territories, and helps collate, fuse and disseminate critical intelligence and information about unusual or suspicious movements and activities at sea.
•	IMAC is the nodal centre of the National Command Control Communications
and Intelligence Network. It is here that data from various sensors and data- bases are aggregated, correlated and then disseminated to various stations for enhanced awareness. The software on which the coastal surveillance will be carried out incorporates hi-tech features like data fusion, correlation and decision support features thus facilitating better decision making.
•	The National Committee to Strengthen Coastal and Maritime Security was
constituted by the government to supervise the implementations of coastal security schemes. The committee is headed by the Cabinet Secretary. The committee meets once in six months and reviews the implementation of various decisions taken as a part of Coastal Security Scheme.

inadequaCies in CoasTal seCuriTy arChiTeCTure
The three-tier coastal security establishment involving the marine police, ICG and Indian Navy makes it difficult to fix accountability if any unfortunate incident occurs. When something happens a blame game begins among the three establish- ments. Each one will vehemently defend their turf and blame the others for any lapses that may occur.
Multiple organisations are involved in the coastal security. In addition to ICG, marine police and Indian Navy, the Customs Department, CISF and BSF are also involved in coastal security. This leads to coordination problems, chaos during operations and frequent misunderstanding among the organisations. This turns out to be counterproductive in terms of coastal security.
The states have been reluctant in giving importance to sea-borne threats. The marine police are poorly equipped and ill trained. The reason is that most
 
 
states do not perceive any real threat to them from the sea. Therefore, coastal security is not on the top of their priorities.
Insufficient funds are cited as a big reason for all the shortfalls in the coastal security. The procurement plans of the Navy and the Coast Guard have been long pending for want of funds. This has made the Navy and ICG woefully short in manpower and firepower.
We do not have a clear maritime policy, which would clearly demarcate the roles and responsibilities of the centre, the states and other agencies involved in coastal security. Coming up with a maritime policy requires cooperation and coordination of all the coastal states and union territories, several ministries and departments and the centre. This proves to be a very uphill task.

CoasTal seCuriTy-sTeps To improve
Ever since the dreadful night of the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008, the govern- ment of India has come up with a number of strategies to fortify coastal and maritime zones along the entire shoreline. Thanks to the tireless efforts of sev- eral departments at the state and national level, the following initiatives are being implemented to ensure that our coastal frontiers are much stronger than before. Due to the heavy surveillance of vessel movement along the western coast, the naval authorities were able to intercept and prevent a potential terror attack off the coast of Porbandar in 2015.
•	At the apex level, the National Committee for Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security (NCSMCS), headed by the cabinet secretary, coordinates all matters related to maritime and coastal security.
•	Joint Operations Centres (JOCs), set up by the Indian Navy as command-
and-control hubs for coastal security at Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Kochi and Port Blair are fully operational. These JOCs are manned 24 × 7 jointly by the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard and Marine Police.
•	Round the clock surveillance of the western coastline is being carried out
through ships and aircrafts. This enables swift detection of potential threats and their mitigation.
Since 2008, coastal and maritime security has been strengthened substantially by successful implementation of technical, organisational and procedural initiatives, by all maritime-security agencies. Plugging gaps, where identified, is a continuous process that is being addressed appropriately.

inter-agency Cooperation
Inter-agency coordination is one of the key components of success during coun- terattack operations. To enhance this feature, the Indian Navy regularly conducts training exercises with 15 national and state agencies.
 
Technological strengthening
To further strengthen coastal security, state-of-the-art technology has been imple- mented for coastal surveillance. It features a secure network of 74 Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers and a chain of 46 coastal radars along the coastline, which can enable quick responses in case of emergencies or potential hazards.

The national Command Control Centre and intelligence network
Inaugurated in 2016, this wide-security network provides data about ships, fish- ing boats, dhows and all other vessels near the coast. By collecting information from multiple technical sources including the AIS and the coastal radar chain, the Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC), Gurgaon, processes the information and disseminates this to all 51 nodes of the navy and coast guard across the coast of India.

Fishermen and Coastal security
The Indian fishing communities are highly adept at seafaring and therefore play a critical role in the domain of maritime security. To harness this potential, regis- tration of fishing vessels, providing them with ID cards and equipping boats with necessary tracking devices have been done. In addition, coastal-awareness cam- paigns and programmes for the fishermen community are being conducted by the Indian Navy and the coast guard. They have been strongly advised to remain within territorial waters and not to cross the maritime boundary.

maritime Training to state police
To provide periodic maritime training to state marine-police units, permanent marine-police training institutes have been commissioned at Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.
To ensure that a repeat of 26/11 doesn’t happen, the navy, air force and the coast guard jointly conduct an annual Defence of Gujarat Exercise for 5 days. On the occasion of the 6th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks, over 30 ships and submarines and aircraft of the Indian Navy, Indian Air Force, coast guard and state agencies were deployed for this exercise off the western coast of India. The defence of offshore oil-production units, which is essential for our energy security, was also tested.

inTroduCTion
Cyber security or information security is securing one’s information systems such as computers, networks, programs and data in cyber space from unauthorised access, theft, change or destruction.
Governments, military, critical infrastructure establishments, corpora- tions, financial institutions, hospitals and others accumulate, save and transmit vast amounts of confidential information across their information systems. Cyber attacks are targeted at both the individual and the collective level. From protecting personal information, cyber security extrapolates into safeguarding national security and sovereignty.






7.1
 
Types of Attacks
The attacks on information infrastructure can be classified into three types:
(a)	Physical attack: In this type, physical damage is inflicted upon the information infrastructure using conventional methods, fire or bomb attack.
(b)	Syntactic attack: In this type, the attack is on the functioning of the information system. System logics are modified and manipulated to perform unintended and unnecessary tasks such as causing delay in processing, shutting down the programs and processes or making the system erratic. Computer viruses and Trojans are the popular tools of syntactic attacks.
(c)	Semantic attack: In this type, the trust and confidence of the system user are exploited. The attacker dupes the user into thinking that they are doing the intended thing when in reality they are doing something different. This kind of attack mostly involves financial scams, stock market crashes, duplication of websites, etc.

Cyber Terrorism
Dorothy Dennings defines cyber terrorism as the convergence of terrorism and cyber space.
Terrorists induce fear by indulging in large-scale disruption and handi- capping of computer systems, sabotaging networks and critical infrastructure by using various tools such as viruses, Trojans, malware, etc. for the further- ance of their political objectives. This is the traditional or conventional way of defining cyber terrorism. The 1998 attack on the Sri Lankan Embassies by the LTTE was considered the first ever act of cyber terrorism.
Going beyond the traditional act of cyber terrorism, an act of cyber terrorism should be looked at much more than causing disruption to computers. It may sometimes lead to violence. Such attacks are even more dangerous than what is considered conventional cyber terror attacks. It is as simple as spreading rumors that can trigger violence. For instance, the rumor that northeast people in Bangalore were attacked resulted in mass exodus of these people back to their states.
It is also the use of cyber space as back-end support to the traditional forms of terrorism like fedayeen attacks, co-ordinated attacks, suicide bomb- ings, soliciting funds, recruiting wannabe terrorists, spreading terrorist propaganda by creating websites and social networking avenues are some ways of lending back-end support to traditional terrorists. This comes under the category of using technology for psychological warfare.
 
 
Tools of Cyber Terrorism/Crime
These are some of the tools that are used by cyber terrorists:


(a)	Hacking: It is a process of having unauthorised access to another person’s computer or information system. A person who performs this activity is referred to as a hacker.
(b)	Trojans: Trojan is an illegitimate programme, which disguises as a legitimate program. It tricks the user into believing that he/she is running a program, which they intend to when in reality an unintended program is being run.
(c)	Computer viruses: They are programmes that replicate themselves continuously on being copied. They can also do things, which can harm the computer. They can be sent as an attachment via e-mail or come attached via a downloaded file or transmitted through external memory devices.
 
(d)	Computer worms: They are similar to a computer virus in that they also replicate. However, they are standalone programmes, meaning they do not need to attach to a file to spread infection and they can be an individual independent program. They spread through network connections or through downloaded file.
(e)	E-mail-related crime: Crimes done using e-mails form the larger threat to cyber space. Spreading rumours, luring people with wrong information, issuing threats and posting defamatory messages, etc. are some types of e-mail-related crimes.
(f)	Denial of service: It is an attempt to deny authorised persons access to an online service. It is done by overwhelming the Website with traffic from multiple sources. A wide variety of important services such as accessing e-mail, Websites, online accounts, online banking services, news Websites, etc. are the main targets.
(g)	Cryptology: Terrorists, fundamentalists, insurgents, rebels, etc. use encryption to mask the data they want to store or communicate. It is not an easy task trying to decrypt the encrypted message.
(h)	Social engineering attacks: In the context of cyber security, social engineering means gaining the confidence of individuals by manipulation and making them divulge confidential information to strangers. The criminals usually trick people into revealing their password, bank details and other confidential information.
(i)	IP spoofing: IP spoofing is gaining unauthorised access of a computer  or network camouflaging one’s identity to that of a trusted host. The IP address of the trusted host is masked by the IP address of the scamster thereby leading the user to the false Website and not the intended site.
(j)	Phishing: Phishing is the method adopted to acquire private information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, etc. An e-mail is sent to the user claiming to be a legitimate enterprise to make the user surrender private information.
(k)	Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of cyber crime whereby, first, a system or network is infected by a malware, which restricts or prevents legitimate users from accessing the computer or network. Then a ransom is sought by the creator of the malware to lift the restriction.
(l)	Skimming: Skimming is a method by which a device is used to steal credit card information. The legitimate credit card is swiped on the device, which steals the data on the magnetic strip of  the credit card and they creates     a clone of the credit card. This credit card information obtained is either directly used by the skimmer or is also sold online. This information is mostly bought by terrorist organisations.
 
 
Cyber WArfAre
It is an illegitimate activity of one nation that is performed by an attempt to damage the information networks of the other nation using computer viruses, worms and other hacking tools. The various ways by which a nation or organ- isation indulges in warfare in cyber space against another nation are.
•	disabling official Websites and networks.
•	disrupting or disabling essential services,
•	stealing classified data,
•	crippling financial systems,
•	sabotaging strategic infrastructures and
•	sabotaging satellites and communication networks.

Types of Cyber WArfAre
1.	Espionage: It is the act of cyber spying engaged by a nation or organisation upon another nation or organisation. A nation acquires secret and classified infor- mation illegally by another nation using various illegal methods on the Internet, networks or individual computers. Nations engage in this type of attack not only during wartime but also during times of peace. Further, a nation engages in cyber espionage not strictly on enemy or rival nations but sometimes on allies, friends and neutral nations.
2.	Sabotage: In this type of cyber warfare, the attack is on a nation’s critical infrastructure such as power plants, air traffic control, nuclear establishments, research facilities, etc. Computers, Websites or networks of these infrastruc- tures are hijacked or blocked from functioning. This is done by hacking into the networks or computers, infecting the systems or networks by viruses or worms or Trojans, spamming the network, employing denial of service tactics, etc. This may lead the nation into crisis or chaos as it disrupts the day-to-day activities of citizens of the nations. Few occurrences of sabotages in the recent past are as follows:
1.	Stuxnet: It is a computer worm that is jointly developed by the United States and Israel to monitor and control the target nation’s industrial facilities like power plants, waste processing systems and other industrial operations. It makes the users to take control of the target nation’s industrial control system without their knowledge. The United States used this computer worm to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program.
2.	GhostNet: It is a spyware that uses a malicious software program called the Remote Access Tool (RAT) to remotely steal sensitive documents and control the system. The Remote Access Tool provides the user the ability to control the target system whenever online. This malware was found in 2009 by the researcher of People’s Republic of China. It has been used on many countries but still there has not been any conclusive evidence that it has been operated by China.
 
ChAllenges To indiA’s Cyber seCuriTy
The information technology (IT) revolution in India has enabled a huge data bank of information to float in cyber space. We set upon the path of electronic governance and are in the process of making every service available digitally. Filing income tax returns, applying for passports and visa, railway ticketing, etc. are fully functional under the governance plan. The criminal justice system – police and judiciary – are also following suit. They are on track to go fully digital. The tourism industry is hugely dependent on cyber space. Almost all Indian banks have opted for full-scale digitalisation. E-commerce is booming. The stock markets have been completely computerised. Further, the Digital India campaign is speeding the process of computerisation of all services – public and private.
The flip side of this revolution, however, is that all these services act as sitting ducks for criminals, terrorists and hostile countries to attack. These act as waiting targets for terrorists to paralyze the economic and financial institutions. The damage can be disastrous and irreparable.
Cyber attacks on critical infrastructures like the banking system, air traffic control, power infrastructure, gas pipelines, etc. can cause havoc. The 2012 power blackout in northern and eastern India was a result of grid fail- ure. We are aware of the chaos and losses that were a result of  the blackout. A similar situation may arise through cyber attacks. The recent Stuxnet virus attack on a nuclear facility in Iran is a wakeup call for us. Though the target was the Iran nuclear facility, it affected installations in India operating with the Siemens system.
According to Internet World Stats, as on 30 June 2015, India has the second most Internet users in the world after China with 354,000,000 users. This is only bound to increase in years to come.
Hacking of Indian government Websites by Pakistan criminals has been on the rise since 2000. China too is evolving as a formidable force to reckon with in cyber space. There are cases of Chinese hacking into national security domains of India. It is reported that China’s People's Liberation Army has trained more than 30,000 cyber warriors to wage war in cyber space as and when desired.
Cyber security must be given special importance in the national secu- rity policy as the world is evolving with computers, criminal activities, and all these will be of high risk to the nation’s security. It is only a matter of time before an all-out cyber war would begin.

Cyber ATTACks AgAinsT indiA
India has been a victim of cyber attack for quite some time now. These attacks mainly originate from two nations, namely, Pakistan and China. These two nations pose the major cyber warfare threats to India.
 
 
Cyber WAr by pAkisTAn
Hackers from Pakistan have been targeting Indian Websites from way back in 1998. These attacks have intensified over the years and today are the single largest source of attacks against India. The groups involved in these attacks include Pakistan Cyber Army, Pakistan G Force, Pakistan Hackers Club and Team_H4tr!ck. These are some of the most notorious groups who attack India’s cyberspace.
In 2010, the Pakistan Cyber Army attacked the website of the CBI and the National Informatics Centre. Similar such attacks from Pakistan are constantly bombarding Indian security establishments. Team_H4tr!ck is the most active of them all and is responsible for hacking numerous Indian websites.
In 2012, post Assam violence, the mass exodus of students belonging to the northeastern region from Bangalore and other areas was caused by rumours spread on social media by Pakistani cyber criminals.

Cyber WAr by ChinA
The attacks arising from China are chiefly in the form of cyber espionage. They siphon off confidential and highly classified information relating to national security. China maintains cyber warriors as part of PLA who indulge in such activities. In 2010, hackers from China attacked the networks of NSA and the Air Force and Navy. A large cache of classified documents was reportedly stolen by these attacks.

exisTing Cyber seCuriTy iniTiATives
information Technology Act, 2000
This act was enacted to provide legality to the operation carried out by means of online communication, which can be referred to as electronic commerce. This is a rising trend in recent days which has replaced paper communication.
The IT Act provides for
•	lawful identification, use and legal protection to digital records and digital signatures in the government and its agencies,
•	preservation of those government records,
•	power to sue for the damage caused to these records,
•	appointment of judicial bodies to render justice or solve the disputes that arise,
•	the Cyber Appellate Tribunal to be established to deal with the disputes and
•	consideration of hacking and other malicious activities as a punishable offence.
 
The Act amended in 2008 provides for
•	impartiality in validation of digital record technology,
•	recognition of publishing materials that have sexually explicit content or some- thing that depicts children in such acts will be considered a punishable offence,
•	provision of authority to inspect and gather information from any com-
puter resource for the purpose of cyber security,
•	provision to establish a national level nodal agency to protect Critical Information Infrastructure; the agency will also deal with research and development to protect it and
•	provision to establish the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT-In) to give instant responses.
Recently the apex court of India invalidated the provisions in Section 66A of the IT Act as it eclipsed the right of free speech and did not balance the right and restrictions on it.
Cyber Appellate Tribunal (CAT)
As per the IT Act 2000, a person who is considered to be aggrieved by an order of any adjudicating officer may appeal before the Cyber Appellate Tribunal, which came into effect in 2009. This CAT is being headed by a chairperson, who is gen- erally appointed the union government.
indian Computer emergency response Team (CerT-in)
It is established as per the provisions in the IT Act, which was amended in 2008, to serve as a national level agency to
•	forecast, collect, analyse and distribute information on incidents of cyber crimes,
•	take emergency measures to handle such crimes,
•	coordinate all the steps and activities performed as a response to the crime and
•	provide advice, whitepapers that are related to the practices that are normally performed in the field of information security.
national information board (nib)
It is an apex agency headed by the national security advisor, which is represented by all the relevant departments that will in turn form a minimum information infra- structure board. It plays an important role by providing various policies for the information security of the country.

national Crisis management Committee (nCmC)
The National Crisis Management Committee, an apex body, headed by the cabi- net secretary consists of secretary-level officers of the Indian government, plays a role of providing directions to the crisis management group during times of major crises.
 
 
national information infrastructure protection Centre (niipC)
The NIIPC is an agency that gathers information and looks into most pos- sible cyber threats to key departments of the government like the defence department. It prepares assessment reports of the member intelligence groups and other enforcement agencies and also protects critical information in the country.

ChAllenges And ConCerns of Cyber seCuriTy
(a)	Lack of awareness among the public and institutions about cyber security.
(b)	Lack of trained manpower and qualified professionals to counter cyber threats.
(c)	The IT Act is old and redundant and is not keeping up with the changing cyber space.
(d)	Poor training infrastructure for cyber security professionals and insufficient supply of qualified trainers.
(e)	Lack of awareness about cyber security in the education sector.
(f)	Lack of private investment in the spheres of cyber security.
(g)	As against the required 5,00,000 cyber security professionals, we have only 50,000. We need at least one million trained professionals by 2020.
(h)	There is a lack of specialised courses in cyber security.
(i)	The scope of IT is expanding across all sectors in the country. The volume of cyber traffic and complexity of the IT ecosystem are rising in the country.
(j)	Fast-changing nature and intensity of threats.
(k)	Difficulty in tracing the origin of attack due to the complexity of cyber space and sophistication of criminals.

governmenT of indiA’s enCrypTion poliCy (repeAled)
What is encryption?
Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorised people can decode them. The process makes use of an encryption key generated by an algorithm to convert plain text (actual mes- sage) into cipher string. This can only be read if decrypted using an appropriate decryption algorithm. As it is a highly sensitive process, it requires large compu- tational infrastructures and skills. Famous messaging services such as Whatsapp, Viber, GoogleChat etc. make use of encryption.
 
how did encryption originate?
Encryption was originally used to secure highly classified military and diplomatic communication. However, with the entry of the Internet and the proliferation of online communication channels, the scope of encryption expanded. The need to protect privacy and information security led to the development of policies that made encryption a default characteristic of Internet-based applications.

What Was the draft encryption policy?
The government of India issued a new draft encryption policy in order to secure the cyberspace. It required that both individuals and businesses have to maintain the plain text for a minimum period of 90 days from the day it was sent to the recipient. Also, the government brought in regulations regarding the algorithms and key size of encrypted data and mandated that service providers enter into an agreement with the government to provide access to plain text.

Concerns regarding the draft encryption policy
For businesses that store sensitive data, this policy defeats the purpose of encryp- tion, as it is vulnerable to cyberespionage through trojans and malwares.
The policy also mandates that people will have to produce the plain text as and when demanded by law-enforcement agencies, under particular laws and regulations. The problem arises when a person may not be able to store plain text data due to a restricted storage space or errors on the communication device. Also, as mentioned before, these are vulnerable to attack by hackers. The other controversial side of the policy is that the responsibility of maintaining the plain text shall be on the user even in case of communication with a foreign entity.
Service providers who use any form of encryption as part of their service should enter into an agreement with the government of India for the purpose. While this could seem logical as the service is used by Indians, it is quite impractical as an online service provider can be anywhere in the world, and the number of such providers runs into thousands.
The government also proposed to prescribe the algorithm and key sizes for encryption. While the government wanted to have easy access to sensi- tive data through this principle, it also exposed the encryption ecosystem to attacks by prescribing a standard encryption algorithm and key size.

nATionAl Cyber seCuriTy poliCy 2013
The National Cyber Security Policy 2013 is a policy that is enacted with the pro- visions to protect information which includes personal, financial or sovereign information.

key highlights
A few strategies that will be put in place to help the government achieve the objectives are listed below:
 
 
•	National-level nodal agency to be formed to co-ordinate matters related to cyber security.
•	Policy envisages each organisation to have its own security policy as per
international standards.
•	The policy also advises all the organisations to not only create a security policy but also to separate a specific amount from its budget for the effec- tive implementation of security policies.
•	As per the policy, the government will provide for assessment certification
for the best practices and guidelines that have been enacted.
•	For challenges and disputes that arise out of the cyber security policy, a separate legal framework must be created.
•	The policy also plans to enforce a periodic audit and evaluation of adequacy
and effectiveness of security of information infrastructure in India.
•	A 24-hour operational response team, Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), to handle crises and proper early warning systems will be put in place in case of vulnerability to cyber threat.
•	The policy plans to invest more in research and development programs
to enhance the nation’s cyber security, and the policy also encourages the organisation to use only certified IT products in sensitive security areas.

sTAnding CommiTTee reporT on Cyber Crime, Cyber seCuriTy And righT To privACy
The Committee chaired by Mr Rao Inderjit Singh submitted its report in February 2014. A few important recommendations of the Committee are listed below:
•	The committee recommended the establishment of the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre to guard against cyber attacks. The need for protecting important information is on the rise now as India is listed among the top five countries that has reported cyber crime cases. So, a protection centre is the need of the hour for the nation to protect its key government departments.
•	The committee opts for a centralised body that can deal with the cyber
crime cases reported nationwide. This centralized body will be connected to many cyber crime cells that will be set in each of the states and its districts.
•	All government organizations should obtain proper International Standards
Organization Certification related to information security.
•	The committee also pointed out that there is need for government spend- ing through budgetary cuts on innovative research and development for the advancement in the security of cyber space.
•	Future programs or technologies like the Cloud under the National
e-governance plan could prove to be risky if the Internet servers of critical sectors have their host outside the Indian border having cost advantages in their mind. So external hosting should be stopped as much as possible, and hosting within Indian borders should be encouraged.
 
•	With respect to the IT Act 2000 and the National Cyber Security Policy of 2013, any action plan must come up with deadlines and targets, and the periodic review must be compulsory.

nATionAl Cyber seCuriTy AgenCy
The strategic dimensions of securing the cyberspace are vast. As a first step towards this initiative, the Prime Minister’s Office created the position of the national cyber security coordinator in 2014. But we do not have a National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) that would develop policy and execute cyber missions as and when necessary.
First, a national institution for this purpose should be setup through an executive or legislative action, with a functional secretariat. The body, headed by the national cyber security coordinator, should consist of a team of permanent and semi-permanent staff that is technically proficient in cyber operations. The team’s technical expertise should feature effective defence and fire-fighting capabilities in the event of a cyberattack.
Second, the agency needs to draft a cybersecurity doctrine much similar to the nuclear doctrine we hold. Third, the aforementioned organisations such as the National intelligence Grid, National Information Board etc. should perform a host of cyber operations in assessing and tackling cyber- threats. Considering the status of the NCSA, being appointed by executive/ legislative action, it should provide the lead for these institutions in terms of strategy and research.
Finally, with this body in place, we should also invest on building our offensive capabilities. This includes development of indigenous software that would invade and intercept digital networks.
Considering the large ambit of power given to this agency, it should report to the PMO and operate under parliamentary oversight.

AAdhAAr And iTs JudgemenT
The constitutional validity of the Aadhaar system (a nationwide biometric identi- fication system) had been challenged before the Supreme Court (SC). This issue was put before a five-judge bench of the Court (Aadhaar Bench). One of the key issues is whether the norms for compilation of the demographic biometric data by the government violates the right to privacy. To answer this question, the SC had to first answer: whether there is a constitutionally mandated funda- mental right to privacy or not. Due to conflicting judgments of the SC in the past, the Aadhaar Bench referred this question before a nine-judge bench of the SC (Privacy Bench) to finally determine whether a fundamental right to privacy existed or not.
A nine-judge bench of the SC has ruled that Indians enjoy a fundamen- tal right to privacy, that it is intrinsic to life and liberty and thus comes under Article 21 of the Indian constitution.
 
 
The nine-judge bench, led by the then Chief Justice J. S. Khehar, pro- nounced a unanimous judgement even if the judges had slightly different arguments as to how privacy is intrinsic to right to life and liberty.
The SC has overruled verdicts given in the M. P. Sharma case in 1958 and the Kharak Singh case in 1961, both of which said that the right to privacy is not protected under the Indian constitution.
Emboldened by the SC’s ‘right to privacy’ verdict, petitioners decided to move the court to settle the Aadhaar matter once and for all.
In 2017: Set up a five-judge bench to hear to hear a plea on the validity of the Aadhaar Act.
One of the first things the apex court did was to have the deadline for linking Aadhaar with various schemes to 31 March 2018.
Soon after, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) asked all banks to expedite linking of Aadhaar to bank accounts but said it was in line with the order the SC gave.
The apex court held that there was a need to balance an individual’s pri- vacy and the State’s responsibility and The Aadhaar Act could not be declared unconstitutional because of citizens being denied services for want of the ID card. All the while, the Centre maintained that it would not deny people their due if they lacked an Aadhaar.

Question 1: Whether the Aadhaar project creates or has tendency to create surveillance state and is, thus, unconstitutional on this ground?

Judgement:
•	The architecture of Aadhaar as well as the provisions of the Aadhaar Act do not tend to create a surveillance state, said the majority order.
•	According to the order, this is ensured by the manner in which the Aadhaar
project operates. Drawing from representations made by the UIDAI and the government, the order stated:
During the enrolment process, minimal biometric data in the form of iris and fingerprints is collected. UIDAI does not collect purpose, location or details of transaction. Thus, it is purpose blind. The in- formation collected, as aforesaid, remains in silos. Merging of silos is prohibited. The requesting agency is provided answer only in ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ about the authentication of the person concerned.
The authentication process is not exposed to the internet world. There are sufficient authentication security measures taken.
There is an oversight by Technology and Architecture Review Board and Security Review Committee.
During authentication, no information about the nature of transaction, etc., is obtained.
The authority has mandated use of Registered Devices for all authenti- cation requests.
 
Question 2: Whether the Aadhaar Act violates the right to privacy and is unconstitutional on this ground?

Judgement:
•	Referring to the earlier decision by the SC that determined privacy to be a fundamental right, the order states that any restraint on privacy must meet three tests:
° backed by law
° legitimate state aim
° proportionality
•	The existence of the Aadhaar Act and delivery of welfare benefits fulfil the first two requirements.
•	The order noted that the third test of proportionality has also been met because:
the purpose of the act is to ensure deserving beneficiaries of welfare schemes are correctly identified;
it also achieves the balancing of two competing fundamental rights: right to privacy on the one hand and right to food, shelter and employ- ment on the other.
•	But the majority order directs that Section 7 of the Act, which says proof of Aadhaar number is necessary for receipt of certain subsidies.
•	As per Section 7 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and
Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, any individual who is desirous of availing any subsidy, benefit or service for which the expendi- ture is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, shall require to fur- nish proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo Aadhaar-based authentication. In case the individual does not have Aadhaar, he/she shall make an application for enrolment and the individual shall be offered alter- nate and viable means of identification for delivery of the subsidy, benefit or service.
•	On that basis, CBSE, NEET, JEE, UGC, etc., cannot make the require-
ment of Aadhaar mandatory as they are outside the purview of Section 7 and are not backed by any law.

Question 3: Whether the Aadhaar Act could be passed as ‘Money Bill’ within the meaning of Article 110 of the Constitution?

Judgement:
•	Since the purpose of the Aadhaar Act is to create unique identification so that citizens can avail government subsidy, benefit or service, the expen- diture for which would be from the Consolidated Fund of India, it can be passed as a money bill.
 
 
other important points
•	Aadhaar–PAN Tax Linkage Maintained.
•	The order upholds Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 that makes it mandatory to quote Aadhaar when filing tax returns or for allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN).

no mandatory use of Aadhaar to open a bank Account
•	The order found that such mandatory provision of Aadhaar to open a bank account or maintain an existing one does not stand the test of proportion- ality and ‘violates the right to privacy of a person which extends to banking details’.
•	No mandatory inking of Aadhaar with mobile number.
•	The order found that since the circular issued by the Department of Telecommunications making such linkage mandatory was not backed by a law, it was illegal and unconstitutional.
•	It is important to note that Justices Chandrachud and Bhushan delivered
separate opinions in this case. While Justice Bhushan concurred with the majority view, Justice Chandrachud found the Aadhaar act ‘to be declared as unconstitutional’. He also stated that the Aadhaar Act was not a money bill, ‘Superseding the authority of Rajya Sabha constitutes as a fraud on the Constitution’.

WAnnACry ATTACk – 2017
•	WannaCry is a type of ransomware that infected the National Health Service (NHS) and other organizations across the globe including govern- ment institutions in China, Russia, the US and most of the Europe.
•	WannaCry attack worstly affected many countries and India was one of
them. The massive ransom ware attack affected NHS England which lead to cancellation of operations of some patients.
•	The discovery of a vulnerability in Microsoft’s Software named EternalBlue
by the USA’s National Security Agency lead to another attack.
•	A hacker group called Shadow Brokers was responsible for the leak of exploit, however, following that Microsoft patched the vulnerability as soon as it happened.
•	The problem came from older versions of Windows or those without
Windows Updates, as these were not patched by Microsoft and were left open to attacks.
•	Russia and India widely used Windows XP-one of he operating system
most at risk, therefore, these counties were hit hard.
•	Ransomware is a malware that stealthily gets installed in our PC or mobile device and holds our files or operating system functions for ransom.
 
•	WannaCry restricts the user from accessing the data on their device until and unless the victim pays some ransom withing three days and if failed to do so, all the encrypted files are deleted and victim losses all the data.
•	Ransomware targets our pictures, documents, files, and data that are per-
sonally invaluable.

hemAChAndrA CommiTTee – 2017
•	In order to strengthen cyber security system, an inter disciplinary panel was set up by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which will examine various threats and will provide suggestions and measures to deal with it.
•	The threats inherent in the existing or emerging technology will also be
reviewed by the panel on an ongoing basis.
•	The panel will also study various security protocols that are being adopted and will act as an interface with stakeholders.
•	For the purpose of strengthening cyber security and resilience, the commit-
tee will also suggest appropriate polity interventions.
•	The recommendations made by the expert panel on information technol- ogy examination and cyber security headed by Meena Hemachandra lead to this decision.
•	The RBI has issued guidelines to banks, mandating cyber security prepared-
ness for addressing cyber risks.
dnA bill
DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2018 is to create a national DNA database for solving crimes and identifying missing persons.
forensic dnA profiling
•	Forensic DNA Profiling has been proved valuable in solving cases that involve human body such as rape, human trafficking, etc. Is also helps in cases involving property such as theft, and dacoity.
•	As per the NCRB records for 2016, these types of crimes are in excess of
3 lakhs per year.
•	Only small proportion of them are subjected to DNA testing at present. The expansion in the use of above mentioned technology would result in both speedier justice delivery and increase in convention rates which cur- rently stands at around 30%.
how dnA profiling Works?
•	The genes encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which can be col- lected from blood, hair, skin cells and other bodily substances, are impor- tant tools in forensic science.
•	Much like fingerprints, a person’s DNA profile is unique, except in case of
identical twins.
•	It helps in establishing the identity of a suspect.
 
 
•	Only small amount of genetic material is needed to create such a profile.
•	Across the world, the use of DNA evidence helped exonerate a number of innocent people.

draft of dnA Technology (use and Application) regulation bill, 2018
•	National DNA Data Bank will be maintained on the basis of different cat- egories, such as:
Crime Scene Index Suspects’ Index Offenders’ index
with a view to ’facilitate identification of persons’.
•	Through this, criminal investigation can become faster, civil cases such as ’parental disputes‘ can also be solved.

issues with dnA bill
•	Consent is not required before bodily substances are drawn from a person accused and arrested for an offence punishable with either death or impris- onment for a term exceeding seven years.
•	In all other cases, a person refusing to part with genetic material can be
compelled to do so if a Magistrate has reasonable cause to believe that such evidence would help establish a person’s guilt. Hence, there is no end to the State’s power in coercing a person to part with DNA.
•	In August 2017, nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Justice K.S.
Puttaswamy vs Union of India declared that the Constitution recognizes a Fundamental Right to Privacy.
•	Protection over the physical body would be included in any meaningful
Right to Privacy.
•	It would impinge on a person’s Right to Privacy.
•	In 2012, group of experts on privacy, led by Justice A.P. Shah, found explic- itly that a person’s basic liberties stand violated by a compelled extraction of DNA from her body.

 
srikrishnA CommiTTee
•	The government had set up the committee under the chairmanship of retired Supreme Court judge Srikrishna in August.


 
Personal data shall be processed only for purposes that are clear, specific and lawful


All firms and agencies will
have to appoint data protection officers


They will also act as point of contact for the individuals for raising grievances


Exemptions have been provided for processing of personal data for journalistic purpose, or for a
purely personal or domestic purpose

The centre shall notify Data protection Authority of India
 
Individuals will have the right to withdraw consent



Firms will have to ensure at least one copy of personal data to be stored in india


‘Critical’ personal data shall only be processed in a server or data centre located in india


Penalties range from 2-4% of a company’s worlwide turnover,  or fines between `5 crore and `15 crore, whichever is higher

A data protection fund and a
data protection awareness fund to be set up through proceeds from the penalties and the fines
 

 
Existing acts such as Right to Information, Aadhaar and Information Technology will have to be amended

major highlights of the report:
•	The law will have jurisdiction over the processing of personal data if the usage, sharing, disclosure, collection or processing of such data occurs in India.
•	In addition, the collection, usage, sharing, disclosing, or otherwise of per-
sonal data by companies incorporated under Indian law also be covered, irre- spective of weather the data has been processed in India or not. However, this law may authorize the Central Government to exclude companies that process the personal data of foreign national not present in India.
•	The law will not have retrospective application and it will come into force
in a structured and phased manner. The Aadhaar Act needs to be amended to bolster data protection.
 
 
•	The data protection law will set up a DPA which will be an independent regulatory body responsible for the enforcement and effective implementa- tion of the law.
•	The Central Government shall establish an appellate tribunal or grant
powers to an existing appellate tribunal to hear and dispose of any appeal against an order of the DPA.
•	Penalties may be imposed for violations of the data protection law. The
penalties imposed would be an amount up to the fixed upper limit or a percentage of the total worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.
•	The state can process data without consent of the user on ground of pub-
lic welfare, law and order, emergency situations where the individual is inca- pable of providing consent, employment, and reasonable purpose.
•	The processing of personal data by both public and private entities will be
covered under this law.
•	Passwords, financial data, health data, official identifier, sex life, sexual ori- entation, biometric and genetic data, and data that reveals transgender sta- tus, intersex status, caste, tribe, religious or political beliefs or affiliations of an individual will be included under Sensitive Personal data. However, the residuary power will be given to the DPA which will notify further catego- ries in accordance with the criteria set by law.
•	Consent will be a lawful basis for processing of personal data. However,
the law will adopt a modified consent framework which will apply a prod- uct liability regime to consent thereby making the data fiduciary liable for harms caused to the data principal.
•	If the personal data, other than critical personal data is being transferred
across the border, it will be done through model contract clauses which includes key obligation lying with the trasnferor who will be held liable for harm caused to the principal because of any violation committed by the transferee.
•	Personal data that has been tagged as critical will be subject to requirement
that it will only be processed in India (there will be a prohibition against transferring this data across border)

Top breAChes in 2018
•	Facebook: Facebook has suffered multiple breaches this year, and the worst breach compromised 50 billion users. The biggest breach, in late September enabled hackers to exploit a weakness in Facebook’s code to access the ‘View As’ privacy tool that allows users to see how their profile looks to other people.
•	Marriott: At the end of November, hotel group Marriott admitted it had suffered a massive data breach affecting the records of up to 500 mil- lion customers. It was revealed by the film that its Starwood division’s
 
guest reservation database had been compromised by unauthorized party. Information accessed included payment information, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers.
•	Quora: Quora suffered a massive breach of the data of it’s users in December. On November 30, the intrusion discovered included up to 100 million users’ names, email addresses, IP addresses, user IDs, encrypted passwords, user account settings, personalization data, public actions and content such as questions, answers, comments, blog posts and upvotes.
•	British Airways: On 6 September, British Airways informed its custom- ers that details from around 380,000 booking transactions had been sto- len, including bank card numbers, expiry dates and cvv codes. It took the firm just one day to announce it had been hit by a cyber-attack between 21 August and 5 September.
•	Ticketmaster: When the hackers stole personal data of 40,000 Ticketmaster customers, it was discovered that there was involvement of  a third-party supplier. Inbenta Technologies, which is responsible for han- dling chatbot on the Ticketmaster site modified a line of JavaScript code trough customization of its product.
•	This code was used by Ticketmaster on its payment page, and when hackers
discovered it, they modified it to extract payment information.
•		Some customers reported their money had been stolen and others claimed their details had turned up for sale on the dark web.
•	The culprit was apparently credit-card skimming criminals Magecart.

Money making is the main reason for indulging in criminal activities. The handling of money in such cases, especially large amount poses problem. Moreover, it can even lead to getting caught by the law enforcement agencies. Thus, ‘Money Laundering’ is the process by which the money obtained from criminal activi- ties, such as, illegal arms sales, extortion, drug trafficking, gambling, bootlegging, smuggling etc., is brought into the financial system by masking and concealing the origin of the money, that is, concealing its illicit origin and make it appear coming from legal source.

DeFInItIons
Various international organizations have dealt with the phenomenon of money laundering and have sought to define it. The following are some of the definitions which will through light on various perspectives:

1.	United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988) (Vienna Convention): ‘The conversion or transfer of property, known that such property is derived from any (drug trafficking) offence or offences of form an act of participation in


8.1
 
such offence or offences, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property of assisting any person who is involved in the commission of such an offence or offences to evade the legal consequences of his actions.
The concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to, or ownership of property, knowing that such property is derived from an offence or offences or from act of participation in such an offence or offences.
The acquisition, possession or use of property knowing at the time of receipt that such property was derived from an offence or offences or from an act of participation in such offence or offences’.
2.	United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: Money laundering is the method by which criminal disguise the illegal origins of their wealth and protect their asset bases, so as to avoid the suspicion of law enforcement agencies and prevent leaving a trail of incriminating evidence’.
3.	IMF: ‘Money laundering is the process by which proceeds from a criminal activity are disguised to conceal their illicit origin’.
4.	Financial Action Task Force: ‘The goal of large number of criminal acts is to generate a profit for the individual or group that carries out the act. Money laundering is the processing of these criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal origin’.
5.	Interpol: Any act or attempted act to conceal or disguise the identity of illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources.

Impact on global economy
1.	Cause of Concern: The major concern of the money laundering arises from its connection with the criminal activities. The entering of illegal money per se in itself is not the cause of concern, rather, the issue lies in the negative effect this is likely to have on the society. Money laundering provides avenue for the criminals to convert their illegal assets to legal form and thereby use their surplus funds in legal avenues which otherwise would have remain idle or spent in luxurious endeavours. Hence, it will have far- reaching effects—economic, political and social.
2.	Economic Effects: The unrestricted and unchecked conversion of illegal money to legal would have adverse effect on the economy. It would create unfair competition between honest and dishonest businesses. This will lead to unfair advantage to the dishonest businesses. Also, it will lead to
 
 
distortion of prices and ultimately have impact on the economic growth. Illegal inflow of money will make the money supply unpredictable thus making the monetary management of the economic situation difficult. Such cross-border movement of illegal money will increase the volatility of the international capital and have impact on the exchange rates.
3.	Social Effects: Corruption and organized crimes are two most important concerns of almost all the countries. Money laundering helps camouflage ill- gotten wealth of corrupt individuals. It helps in perpetration and structuring of the organized crimes. Thus, in places where there is lag in control of money laundering, it leads to increase in corruption and financial frauds. Moreover, such places will act as safe-haven for criminals leading to more detrimental effect on their social environment.
4.	Political Effects: Increase in clout of criminal elements in places where money laundering is prevalent will lead them to influence the social and political systems. And in time, they will gain control over the socio-political system of the country and ultimately will lead to degradation of the democratic system.

terrorIsm FInancIng
Terrorism financing means that deliberately mobilizing or collecting funds in order to support terrorist acts or organization. This funding can arise from both legitimate and illegal sources. In this process the terrorist financers conceal both the origin/source of finance and the activity for which it is used. There is no fixed amount to finance terrorist acts or organizations, however such organiza- tion requires substantial amount of money to run, maintain and sustain them.

Definition
As per the UN’s International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999).
Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this convention if that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and willingly, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be sued or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part in order to carry out:
(a)	An act which constitutes an offence within the scope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex; or
(b)	Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civil- ian, or to any other person not taking any active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing an act.
 
For an act to constitute an offence set forth above, it shall not be necessary that the funds were actually used to carry out an offence referred to in (a) or (b).

Difference in perspective
The major issue is that not all countries have adopted the convention defining what constitutes terrorism, and there is no universally accepted meaning for ter- rorism because of political, religious and national inclinations which differ from country to country.

money laundering and terrorist Financing
These two are difference phenomenon. In money laundering the source is ille- gal and hidden, while the use of these funds becomes legal; whereas in terror- ism financing the source of funds might be either legal or illegal, but these are used for perpetrating terrorist activities and sought to be concealed. In both the cases there is illegitimate use of the financial sector to conceal the funds. The methods/techniques used to launder money is similar to those used to conceal the source and uses of terrorist financing. Thus, steps taken to prevent money laundering will also help to detect and deter terrorism finance related activities.

methoDs oF money launDerIng
The process of money laundering is accomplished in three ways:
1.	Placement
2.	Layering
3.	Integration


These phases occur either distinctly in phases or in overlapping manner. The money which is laundered undergoes the above steps and various methods or their variants to complete the money laundering sequence. Moreover, the use of methods depends also on the type of control whether weak or non-existent. Thus, the financial heavens offer host of services to foreign investors who want anonymity to stash their unaccounted wealth.
 
placement
This step is where the cash is physically disposed in bulk. The cash is taken away from the place of collection and taken to place where it could be disguised and is placed into formal or informal financial institutions or into retail sector or taken out of the country.
Role of Formal Financial Institutions
The formal financial institutions such as the banks and other institutions play important role in transmitting the money involved in the money laundering pro- cess. Depositing of the money in such institutions is a very important step in the money laundering sequence. In order to curb this practice, the legal systems specify reporting of cash transaction over and above some threshold limit and reporting of suspicious transactions.
Smurfing
In order to evade the check instituted by the legal systems, the money launderers mask the deposits by breaking them into smaller deposits which is smaller than the threshold limit. This process is known as smurfing. Through this method, the individual cash reporting can be avoided as the cash transacted is lesser than the reporting value.
The next step in the money laundering process is the depositing of the money in such accounts which provide protection. This kind of protection is present where the beneficial owners of the company need not be disclosed in the country where it has headquarters, hence deposits can be made into such accounts. Deposits can also be made in the trusts, which can be e-operated by the trustees without disclosing who the beneficiaries are, or the deposits can also be made in the name of clients of the members of legal profession to whom the rules of attorney confidentiality may apply. Even if identity disclosure is pres- ent, the corrupt bank officials may collude with the money launderers and accept deposits by creating false identities.
Currency Smuggling
The above said smurfing process in reality is cumbersome as it involves numer- ous transactions to be made in smaller denominations. Also, if there is an effec- tive system to detect suspicious bank transactions, the money launderer would not prefer the banking route to send the cash for the laundering purpose. In such cases, the money would be smuggled from a well-regulated country to a country having ineffective regulation, and the money is deposited in financial institutions of such countries from where it will be transferred to the desired country. Such transactions involving trillions of dollars are made every day and thus the launderers can escape detection from the law enforcement agencies. The currency can be smuggled though air, land, sea and mail. The smuggling of currency through air is preferred as it is faster and the carrier can be close to the money.
 
Role of Informal Financial Institutions
The informal financial are also utilized in the money laundering process. Through currency exchanges and money services, the money launderer buys foreign cur- rency which can be then transported out of the country. Wire services can help transfer money outside the country to other accounts. Other institutions such as the commodities broker, securities broker, gold/silver and other precious metal brokers/dealers, casinos, etc., use money launderers. Informal set-up such as informal bankers, including that of hawala or hundi is used to launder money which comes from criminal activities.

Hawala
This is an alternate form of remittance system which is popular in coun- tries such as India and Pakistan. The term hundi is also used interchange- ably. This process is also known as chop shop and chiti banking. Hawala is a means of transfer of money which is based on trust or reference. Generally, the charges for transferring money under hawala is much lower than the nor- mal bank charges. The broker or dealer is called as the hawaladar. This system includes addition or transfer of money by manipulating the invoices to conceal the movement of money in shipment of goods and also in smuggling of gold security dues.
The process of money transfer is simple, if anyone from country A intends to send money to someone in country B, he is required to pay the required money and a commission to the hawaladar in country A. The hawaladar then sends a mes- sage to his associate hawaladar in country B to deliver the money. The hawaladar then sends the required amount to the person in country B.
The settlement of dues between hawaladars is carried out by way of dou- ble invoicing. This is carried out as follows, the hawaladar in country A may buy items of export worth ` 10,00,000. He would send these items to the hawaladar in country B with an invoice of ` 5,00,000. The hawaladar in coun- try B then sells the goods worth ` 10,00,000 and sends ` 5,00,000 back to the hawaladar in country A and thus retains ` 5,00,000 towards hawala pay- ments. Similarly, over invoicing is also carried out to settle dues between the hawaladars.
The system of hawala is said to facilitate the criminal activities because of its anonymity, speed and absence of paper trail. Thus criminals, drug traffickers, corrupt officials and politicians use this method to transfer their wealth for laun- dering purpose.

Other Methods of Placement
The money launderers take over cash transaction business such as hotels, exchange bureaus, casinos, which has huge cash inflow. They then mix the pro- ceeds of crime, by including them in the receipts of business and thereby show- ing them to be legitimate return from business.
 
In the method of refining, smaller denomination bills are exchanged for larger ones and then converted at number of different banks to avoid detection.

layering
In this process, the proceeds of crime are separated from their source by creat- ing a complex layer of financial transactions which are deliberately designed to morph the audit trail of illicit money. Such complicated layers of transaction will make the traceability extremely difficult by the enforcement agencies. ‘Megabyte Money’ which are in form of computer-generated symbols operate 24 hours a day, and will be shifted numerous times to avoid detection by the agencies.
Monetary Instruments
Once the proceeds of crime are successfully places, they are then converted into financial instruments such as bonds, money orders, traveller’s cheques and stocks. These forms are easy to transport them out from the country of origin.
Electronic Funds Transfer or Wire Transfer
This is one of the important layering methods used by the launderers as it has minimal audit trail, anonymity and speed, etc.
Asset Purchase
High values assets such as cars, boats, gold, art works etc., are purchased and re-sold either domestically or exported and proceeds from these are obtained in non-cash form.
Corporate Techniques
Offshore front corporations which are generally licensed to conduct business only outside the country of incorporation are obtained by the launderers. These corporations are exempt from tax and other regulatory obligations and are pro- tected by secrecy laws. Bank accounts are opened in the safe heavens in name of such corporations and proceeds of crime are deposited in them. They are thus, free from regulatory obligation and are protected by secrecy laws. Thus, pro- tected by corporate secrecy and banking secrecy provisions, the proceeds from the crime can be used as payment as load for the criminal himself or can be used for other investments or transfer which mask the illegal nature of the origin of such money.

Integration
The illegally obtained money is given stamp of recognition and this money re-enters economy in form of normal business earning.
Sham Loans from Front Companies—Offshore Haves and Bank Secrecy
By this method, paper works for load or mortgage are created. The launderer then obtains a sham loan from the front company which is usually incorporated in tax haven countries. This, therefore, creates an image that the loan obtained
 
by the criminal is legitimate. The front company has been incorporated with the laundered money and it runs to launder and legitimize the money. The launder- ers also avail benefits such as income tax benefits, tax holiday, etc. Money is also transferred from one country, in offshore heaven to destination country, these banks are referred as ‘off shore shelf banks’ and these are also established and managed by the launderers or their agents.
Countries such as Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Antilles, Cyprus, Hong Kong, etc., are regarded to be offshore heavens.
Real Estate Transactions
Properties are bought in the name of the front companies from the laundered money and then sold, the proceeds of such sale are given the colour of legiti- macy as being legitimate proceeds of business.
Value Tampering
This is a method by which the money launderer received property from the owner for lesser price and pays the difference in form of cash and thereafter sells the same for higher value. For example, the property worth 20 lakhs is bought on papers for 10 lakh and the difference of 10 lakh is paid as cash and thereafter the launderer sells the property for 20 lakh or for higher value and shows the entire amount received to be legitimate.
Double Invoicing
The price of goods shown in the invoice is manipulated. The difference in actual price of goods are deposited in the country where the goods are received and then it is repatriated. Various techniques, such as over-invoicing, under-invoicing, etc., are used by the operators.
 
 
aDverse eFFects oF money launDerIng
The following are some of the adverse effects of money laundering:
•	It can weaken the social fabric and collective ethical standards.
•	It can destabilize the financial system and weaken the development efforts taken in the emerging markets.
•	It can pose challenge to the economic system by changing the demand
for cash, making the interest and exchange rates more volatile, cause inflation, etc.
•	Flow of illegal unaccounted money from the economies cause instability
and threat to the global market.
•	It empowers and supports corruption and organized criminal activities.
•	The origin or the source of the money is disguised by the criminals and are used to obtain assets, properties and make investments in other forums. Steps are taken to conceal the source of such money thereby, raising no suspicion when it is used.
•	The globalization has helped criminals quickly transfer money across the
countries. Thus, development of technology has resulted in quick and speedy transfer of criminal wealth across nations. This, thus, has led to financial crunch.
•	Financial secrecy in some jurisdiction has helped the launderers to convert
the ill-gotten wealth as legitimate source of money and bring it back into the system. Thus, banking and financial secrecy pose hurdle for curbing the money laundering activities.
•	The money which is laundered is utilized once again by the criminal ele-
ments to increase their power and reach. They now legitimately buy assets and properties and create unfair competition in the market.
•	It is estimated that the money laundering transaction involves around 2 to 5
per cent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Thus, it is increasingly realized that money laundering is a crime and steps are being taken to counter it and to confiscate the proceeds of crime from the criminals.

neeD For combatIng money launDerIng
The proceeds of the crime are liable for seizure and confiscation, and when seized and produced by the enforcement agency, it would be taken as admissible evidence and strengthen the prosecution case against the criminals. The inter- national initiatives such as signing of the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 and the Convention of Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime, opened for signature on 8 November 1990 referred to as the ‘Strasbourg Convention’, obligated other legal systems to enact laws for confiscation of proceeds  of crime.
 
Since, the criminal proceeds were also confiscated, the criminals started using the money laundering methods to disguise the proceeds of the crime. Thus, the illegal profits of the criminals are masked and they are brought back as legiti- mate source and are ploughed back into the system. Money laundering methods are used in criminal activities that generate significant amount of profit, such as trafficking of women, children, body parts, corruption, arms smuggling, other white-collar crimes, etc.
The important issue in money laundering is that everything is kept secret. The evidence in this crime is the ‘money trail’ left behind by the launderers, these are generally intricate and often complex, the launderers design it to make them seem legitimate, and in many cases, it is difficult to distinguish the crime from the money laundering process. The present technological advancement in the e-commerce sector where paper trail is kept minimum act as another hurdle in curbing the money laundering activities.
The international tax havens are generally used by the launderers as they have lax laws and provide adequate protection and secrecy to their actions. Thus, money laundering is carried out in comparatively easier manner. Thus, crimi- nals move out their proceeds of crime to other jurisdiction, thus, the problem of money laundering has taken global perspective and is carried out internationally across continents.
Money laundering problem was initially thought to be the problem of the West especially in countries such as USA where large amount of drug-related money is laundered. Development of technology and internet has given the launderers power to penetrate into financial sector of any jurisdiction with ease. Lightning speed cash transactions, high value cards, make transfer of money sim- ple and easier. The money laundering thus, uses both the formal financial institu- tions and non-financial institutions for changing the character of the proceeds of crime. Thus, in order to curb this practice, the countries have to develop ways which are both preventive and punitive.

global InItIatIves
There is increasing awareness around the globe about the negative fallout and international ramifications of the money laundering activities. Hence, interna- tional level cooperation and initiatives are required to combat such activities. The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988, was the first major international efforts against laundering of proceeds of crime generated from illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. This was followed by establishment of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) by G-7 countries in their 15th Economic Summit held in Paris on 16 July 1989. FATF was established to promote development of effective anti-money laundering controls and to encourage cooperation to counter-money laundering efforts around the world. The first report on the FATF was published in April 1990, which contained 40 recommendations to counter money laundering. These recommendations are comprehensive
 
 
strategies which the governments of every country have to initiative to counter money laundering.

Financial action task Force
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body estab- lished in 1989 by the Ministers of its member jurisdictions. The mandate of the FATF is to set standards and to promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terror- ist financing and the financing of proliferation, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. In collaboration with other inter- national stakeholders, the FATF also works to identify national-level vulnerabili- ties with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse.
The FATF recommendations set out a comprehensive and consistent framework of measures which countries should implement in order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Countries have diverse legal, administrative and operational frameworks and different financial systems, and so cannot take all identical measures to counter these threats. The FATF recommendations, there- fore, set an international standard, which countries should implement through measures adapted to their particular circumstances. The FATF recommendations set out the essential measures that countries should have in place to:
•	Identify the risks, and develop policies and domestic coordination.
•	Pursue money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation.
•	Apply preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated
sectors.
•	Establish powers and responsibilities for the competent authorities (e.g., investigative, law enforcement and supervisory authorities) and other insti- tutional measures.
•	Enhance the transparency and availability of beneficial ownership informa-
tion of legal persons and arrangements.
•	Facilitate international cooperation.

extent oF problem oF money launDerIng In InDIa
It does have a huge problem of the black economy. This is unaccounted and holders of black money launder it back to acquire legitimate assets. Such kind of legal or illegal income which evades the formal system in order to avoid tax bur- den constitutes the unreported Gross Domestic Product or the black economy. There is a minute difference between laundering the black money and laundering the proceeds of crime, in the former the source of income might be legitimate and money is laundered in order to evade payment of tax, whereas in the lat- ter, the income generated is from illegal and unlawful sources such as criminal activities.
In Ram Jethmalani vs Union of India, it was stated by the petitioners before the Supreme Court that there had been a slew of reports, in the media, and also in scholarly publication that various individuals, mostly citizens, but may also include non-citizens, and other entities with presence in India, have gener- ated, and secreted away large sums of monies, through their activities in India or
 
relating to India, in various foreign banks, especially in tax havens, and jurisdic- tions that have strong secrecy laws with respect to the contents of bank accounts and the identities of individuals holding such accounts. The petitioners alleged that most of such monies were unaccounted, and in all probability had been gen- erated through unlawful activities, whether in India or outside India, but relating to India. The petitioners contended that the sheer volume of such monies point to grave weakness in the governance of the nation, because they indicate a sig- nificant lack of control over unlawful activities through which such monies are generated, evasion of taxes, and use of unlawful means to transfer of funds. That these funds were then laundered and brought back to India, to be used in both legal and illegal activities. That the use of various unlawful modes of transfer of funds across borders, gave support to such unlawful networks of international finance. That inasmuch as such unlawful networks were widely acknowledged to also effectuate transfer of funds across borders in aid of various crimes com- mitted against persons and the State, including but not limited to activities that might be classifiable as terrorist, extremist, or unlawful narcotic trade, the pre- vailing situation also had very serious connotations for the security and integrity of India. The petitioners further contended that a significant part of such large unaccounted monies included the monies of powerful persons in India, and its agencies, had been very lax in terms of keeping an eye on the various unlawful activities generating unaccounted monies, the consequent tax evasion; and that such laxity extended to efforts to curtail flow of such finds out, and into, India.
Thus, money laundering pose serious threat to India and number of steps are being taken to curb and curtail this practice.

high profile money laundering cases in India
The following are some of the high-profile money laundering cases in India:
•	Commonwealth Games Scam 2010: 70,000 Crore Scam
It is estimated that out of 70,000 crore spent on the Games, only half of the said amount was spent on Indian sportspersons. Discrepancies in ten- ders-like payment to non-existent parties, willful delays in execution of con- tracts, overinflated price and bungling in purchase of equipment through tendering, and misappropriation of funds.
•	Group Financial Scandal 2013: A 4000 Crore Scam
Financial scam caused by the collapse of a Ponzi Scheme run by Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies that were believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds.
•	Indian Coal Allocation Scam 2012: 185,591 Crore Scam
Private companies got coal blocks allotted, not auctioned, leading to esti- mated losses as per the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Supreme Court canceled all 214 coal blocks allocations since 1993. Government to e-auction the coal blocks now.
 
•	2G Scam 2008: 176,000 Crore Scam
Many telecommunications company’s communication bandwidths auc- tioned for lower than market value. A. Raja and M. K. Kanimozhi have been in Tihar Jail for 15 months and five months respectively.
•	Shabir Shah
The Enforcement Directorate Filed charge sheet against Kashmiri separat- ist leader Shabir Shah as he generated funds from Pakistan and other coun- tries to carry out unrest in the Valley.
•	Zakir Naik
Mr Naik’s fundamentalist approach to religion has long been controversial. Many detained Al-Qaeda followers have reportedly told officials that he has a huge influence on them. He was banned from entering the UK in 2010 for ‘unacceptable behaviour’, and because of his speeches, by then
home secretary (and now Prime Minister) Theresa May.
In November 2016, India’s counterterrorism agency filed an official complaint against Mr Naik, accusing him of promoting religious hatred and unlawful activity. Mr Naik moved to Malaysia in 2017. India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED), filed the charges against Mr Naik in court.

preventIon oF money launDerIng—InDIan InItIatIves
In India, before the enactment of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) the major statutes that incorporated measures to address the problem of money laundering were:
•	The Income Tax Act, 1961
•	The Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA)
•	The Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act, 1976 (SAFEMA)
•	The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPSA)
•	The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988
•	The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988
•	The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2000, (FEMA)
prevention of money laundering act
The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 was enacted to prevent money laundering and provide for confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Act also addressed international obligations under the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations to prevent money laundering.
 
To strengthen the provisions of the PMLA, amendments were carried out in 2009. These amendments have introduced new definitions to clarify and strengthen the Act and strengthened provisions related to attachment of property involved in money laundering and its seizure and confiscation. More offences have been added in Parts A and B of the Schedule to the Act, including those pertaining to insider trading and market manipulation as well as smuggling of antiques, terrorism funding, human trafficking other than prostitution, and a wider range of environmental crimes. A new category of offences with cross- border implications has been introduced as Part C.
The problem of black money is no longer restricted to the geopolitical boundaries of any country. It has become a global menace that cannot be con- tained by any nation alone. In view of this, India has become a member of the FATF and APG on Money Laundering, which are committed to the effective implementation and enforcement of internationally accepted standards against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Consequent to the submission of an action plan to the FATF for bringing India’s anti-money laundering legis- lation on par with international standards and to address some of the deficien- cies of the Act that have been experienced by the implementing agencies, PMLA 2002 is further proposed to be amended through the Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill 2011, which is under consideration of Parliament. The Bill seeks to introduce the concept of ‘corresponding law’ to link the provi- sions of Indian law with the laws of foreign countries and provide for transfer of the proceeds of the foreign predicate offence in any manner in India. It also proposes to enlarge the definition of the offence of money laundering to include therein activities like concealment, acquisition, possession, and use of proceeds of crime as criminal activities and remove the existing limit of ` 5 lakhs for impo- sition of fine under the Act. It also strengthens provisions for attachment and confiscation of the proceeds of crime and widens the investigative powers of the Director and clubs’ offences listed under Schedules A and B into a single Schedule.

the undisclosed Foreign Income and assets (Imposition of tax) act, 2015
The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Act, 2015, has been brought in as a comprehensive measure to deal with black money stashed away and to deter people from parking unaccounted money overseas. It pro- vides for separate taxation of any undisclosed income through foreign sources and assets. With this law in place, foreign income will no longer be administered under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Important provisions of the act
•	The Act will apply to all person resident in India and will apply to both undisclosed foreign income and assets.
 
•	Undisclosed foreign income or assets shall be taxed at a flat rate of 30 per cent.

penalty
•	The penalty for non-disclosure of income will be 90 per cent of the income, in addition to the tax payable. (90 per cent penalty + 30 per cent tax = 120 per cent of income).
•	The failure to furnish returns in respect of foreign income or assets shall
attract a penalty of ` 10 lakhs. This shall also be applicable in cases where a person has filed returns but has not disclosed foreign income or has filed inaccurate data of the same.
prosecutions
•	Wilful attempts to evade tax in relation to foreign income or an asset out- side India will entail rigorous imprisonment of a minimum of three years up to ten years.
•	The Act provides for the prosecution of a minimum of six months up to
seven years in the following cases:
Failure to furnish a return in respect of foreign assets and bank accounts or income.
Although an assessee has filed a return of income but has not disclosed the foreign asset or has furnished inaccurate particulars of the same.
Beneficial owners or beneficiaries of such illegal foreign assets. Abetment or inducement of another person to make a false return or a false account or statement or declaration under the Act.
This provision will also apply to banks and financial institutions assist- ing in the concealment of foreign income or assets of resident Indians or falsification of documents.
safeguards
In order to embed the principles of natural justice and due process of law, the following measures have been taken:
•	Mandatory issue of notices to the concerned person.
•	Grant of opportunity of being heard.
•	Necessity of taking the evidence produced by him/her into account.
•	Recording of reasons, passing of orders in writing, limitation of time for various actions of the tax authority, etc.
•	Right of appeal for the person concerned, to approach the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal and to the jurisdictional high court and the Supreme Court on substantial questions of law.
•	Exemption for foreign accounts with minor balances which may not have
been reported out of oversight or ignorance, with a maximum balance of up to ` 5 lakhs at any time during the year.
 
one-time compliance opportunity
•	The Act also provides for a one-time compliance opportunity for a limited period to those who have any undisclosed foreign assets, which have not been disclosed for the purposes of income tax. Such persons may file a declaration before the tax authority within a specified period, followed by payment of tax at the rate of 30 per cent and an equal amount by way of penalty. These persons will not be prosecuted under the provisions of this Act.

amendment to prevention of money laundering act
•	The Act also includes the offence of tax evasion as a scheduled offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.

benami transactions (prohibition) amendment act, 2016
The Government of India brought a new law in August 2016 in order to curb the practice of buying property through benami deals. The law came into effect since November 2016 and prohibits benami transactions, with 7 years of imprisonment and stringent penalties for those who indulge in the activity.

What Is benami?
Benami in essence means property without a name. Here, the person who intends to buy the property buys it under a third person’s name, so as to avoid whose name the property is purchased is called the benamidar, and the property is referred to as benami property. The benamidar would only be a titular holder, while the person financing the deal could be the sole exploiter of the returns that arise from that property.
There are many kinds of assets that are considered for the purpose of this law—movable, immovable, tangible, intangible, any right or interest in a com- pany or legal documents; even gold or financial securities can qualify to be benami properties.

amendments
The amendment adds other transactions which qualify as benami, such as prop- erty transactions where: (i) the owner is not aware or denies knowledge of the ownership of the property, (ii) transaction is made in a fictitious name and (iii) person providing the consideration for the property is not traceable.
According to the new law, people caught with benami properties could serve up to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and have to pay a significant fine. Additionally, the properties will be confiscated. Under the Act, a transaction is named benami if property is held by one person but has been provided or paid for by another person.
 
The Act provides for the creation of an appellate mechanism called the Adjudicating Authority and Appellate Tribunal.

second arc recommendations on prevention of money laundering
1.	The Prevention of Money Laundering Act can be amended at any time to widen its scope and ambit.
2.	The juncture at which the case requires a search and seizure action may be advanced as permitted under the Act when it involves a wider ramification and adequate safeguards may also be provided.
3.	Strengthening of institutional coordination between the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and other information collecting and investigating agencies can be done.
4.	The financial transaction-reporting authority under the FIU can be expanded to protect high risk sectors.
5.	The Regional Economic Intelligence Council can be used for increased coordination by investigation agencies. The FIU should furnish all region- centric information to the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau to provide it to the respective Regional Economic Intelligence Council to expand the information regime.
6.	A special cell shall be formed in the anticipated National Counter Terrorism Centre with expertise from the ministries and the Cabinet Secretariat for taking action on the information gathered. Further, anti-terrorist finance cells are to be incorporated within every investigating agency to deal with financial transactions.
7.	Dedicated teams can be formed within the investigating agencies for speedy investigation for cases related to terrorist activities. This can be achieved by appointing officers with specialization in various aspects of financial investigation.

anti-money laundering standards
RBI issued Master Circular on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms/Anti- Money Laundering (AML) standards/Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/Obligation of banks under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and Banks were advised to follow certain customer identification procedure for opening of accounts and monitoring transactions of a suspicious nature for the purpose of reporting it to appropriate authority. These ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) guidelines have been revisited in the context of the recom- mendations made by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards and on Combating Financing of Terrorism
 
(CFT). Detailed guidelines based on the recommendations of FATF and the paper issued on Customer Due Diligence (CDD) for banks by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), with suggestions wherever con- sidered necessary, have been issued. Banks/FIs have been advised to ensure that a proper policy framework on ‘Know Your Customer’ and Anti-Money Laundering measures is formulated and put in place with the approval of their Boards.
The objective of the KYC norms/AML measures/CFT guidelines is toward prevent the banks from being manipulated either intentionally or unin- tentionally by the criminal elements for carrying out money laundering or ter- rorism financing activities. These procedures also enable banks to under their customer and carry out financial dealings in a better manner and help manage risks effectively.
Apart from these the following institutions play significant role in curbing the money laundering activities,

enforcement Directorate
The ED was established in 1956 to administer the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1973 (FERA). However, FERA was repealed on 31 May 2000 and replaced with the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA) which came into force with effect from 1 June 2000.
The ED has currently been entrusted with the investigation and prosecu- tion of money laundering offences and attachment/confiscation of the proceeds of crime under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA). The officers of the ED undertake multifaceted functions of collection, collation and development of intelligence, investigation into suspected cases of money laun- dering, attachment/confiscation of assets acquired through the commission of scheduled offences, and the criminal prosecution of the offenders in the court of law. The ED also enforces the provisions of FEMA, aimed at promoting the development and maintenance of India’s foreign exchange market and provid- ing, inter alia, for action against persons/entities involved in international hawala transactions.
The ED also administers the PMLA. The PMLA contains provisions related to investigation into the cases of money laundering and powers of search, seizure, collection of evidence, prosecution, etc., for which the ED is the competent authority. Under the PMLA, ‘money laundering’ is a criminal offence and extends to any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence (as per Annexure-1). After a 2009 amendment, predicate offences for money launder- ing also extend to conduct that occurred in another country which constitutes an offence in that country and which would have constituted a predicate offence had it occurred domestically. The ED initiates investigations only after a law enforcement agency registers a case under any one of the offences listed in the Schedule to the Act.
 
Financial Intelligence unit
The FIU-IND was established by the Government of India vide an Office Memorandum dated 18 November 2004 for coordinating and strengthening efforts for national and international intelligence by investigation and enforce- ment agencies in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. FIU-IND is the national agency responsible for receiving, processing, analysing, and dis- seminating information relating to suspect financial transactions. It is an inde- pendent body reporting to the Economic Intelligence Council headed by the Finance Minister. For administrative purposes, the FIU-IND is under the control of the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.
Under the Rules issued under the PMLA, the following types of reports have been prescribed for the reporting entities:
•	Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs)
•	Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)
•	Counterfeit Currency Reports (CCRs)
•	Non-Profit Organizations Transaction Reports (NTRs)
The FIU-IND’s functions are defined under the PMLA. The Director, FIU- IND is empowered under Sections 12, 13, and 66 of the PMLA for exercise of powers relating to collection and dissemination of information. Powers relat- ing to search and seizure are exercised by the ED. Notification No. 5/2005, dated 1 July 2005 confers various powers under the PMLA on the Director, FIU-IND.
For ensuring the availability of information with the FIU, Section 12 of the PMLA requires every banking company, financial institution, and intermediary (the reporting entities) to furnish information to the FIU and verify the identity of their clients in the manner prescribed. The reporting entities are also required to maintain and preserve records of transactions and identity of clients for a period of ten years from the date of cessation of transactions. Section 13 of the PMLA empowers the Director, FIU to call for records maintained by a reporting entity and enquire into cases of suspected failure of compliance with the provi- sions of the PMLA and also to impose fine.

central economic Intelligence bureau
The CEIB functioning under the Ministry of Finance is responsible for coor- dination, intelligence sharing, and investigations at national as well as regional levels amongst various law enforcement agencies. The existing coordination mechanism in the CEIB consists of Regional Economic Intelligence Councils (REICs) at regional level and the Group on Economic Intelligence and meetings of the heads of investigating agencies under the Department of Revenue at the Centre. While the Group on Economic Intelligence is focussed on matters relat- ing to intelligence sharing, the REICs and heads of agencies meetings cover both intelligence and investigations.
 
As per the charter of the CEIB, it has been assigned the responsibility of acting as the ‘think tank’ on issues relating to economic offences including data collection and collation policies and preparation and maintenance of dos- siers of tax evaders, violators of economic laws, white-collar operators, etc. It also examines emerging trends and changing dynamics of economic offences. It takes note of the nexus among various stakeholders of these activities, their modi operandi and suggests measures for effectively dealing with them. It also analyses the macroeconomic impact of such activities and is the nodal agency for coordination at international level. It coordinates with the National Security Council Secretariat on matters having a bearing on national and economic security.
Human intelligence continuous to be the most important source of gathering information about evasion of various taxes and duties and genera- tion of black money. During the course of investigation of customs offence cases, the CEIB comes across information relating to generation and park- ing of black money. All such information is shared with the relevant depart- ments/agencies for further investigation and necessary action as may be warranted. In such matters interagency cooperation and sharing of informa- tion play a vital role.
Any information on black money or money laundering or hawala transac- tions is regularly shared with the ED and Director General of Income Tax so that proper action on all accounts is initiated in the matter. Evidence is shared with the ED to help establish cases of money laundering and hawala operations by unscrupulous importers/exporters and hawala operators. Cases of unaccounted cash recovery are reported to the DGIT (Investigation), CBDT to establish the source of the money and its proper accounting.
The CEIB maintains constant interaction with its Customs Overseas Investigation Network (COIN) offices to share intelligence and information on suspected import/export transactions. The COIN offices gather evidence through diplomatic channels from the foreign custom offices and other foreign establishments to establish cases of misdeclaration which are intricately linked with tax evasion and money laundering.

White paper on black money—government of India
•	The generation of black money takes place through:
(i)	Illegal acts like drug trade, terrorism and corruption or;
(ii)	Voluntarily hiding the pay dues from the public exchequer in one form or another.

special Investigation team recommends steps to curb money laundering
The Supreme Court appointed a SIT to curb money laundering, and the team has proposed a list of recommendations:
•	The team has advised action for trade-based money laundering; placing a ceiling on bigger cash transactions as these take place through illicit activi- ties like drug trade and betting.
•	The team has emphasized the need to verify the creation of black money in
sectors like education and in the form of donations to religious institutions and trusts.
•	The report has stressed on the need to establish additional courts to settle
on the pending cases under the IT Act; also, the report emphasizes on the establishment of Central KYC Registry and empowers the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) under the Special Economic Zone Act.
•	A recommendation has been made to eliminate the generation of black
money through betting in cricket.
•	The SIT has suggested that SEBI will need to have a monitoring mecha- nism to review the unusual rise in stock prices while dealing with illegal use of capital gain tax in the long-term.
•	The ED must be informed to take necessary action for the offences under
the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
•	As the participatory notes can be misused for money laundering, it is very important to obtain information on the beneficial ownership to prevent it from being misused. SEBI must be informed about the individual under KYC norms.
 
•	If the company or any organization becomes the holder of a participa- tory note, then SEBI should take information about the promoters and the directors of the company under the KYC norms.
•	The transferable nature of the participatory notes makes it very difficult to
trace the true beneficial owner since layering of transaction can be a com- plex process. SEBI needs to examine the provision of allowing the transfer of participatory notes to be beneficial for ease of foreign investment. And any investor who wants to invest will invest freshly through a foreign port- folio investor instead of buying from a participatory note holder.

view of the supreme court on the subject
The following views of the Supreme Court on the subject of money laundering are pertinent:
‘The incidence of crime, petty and grand, like any other social phenomena is often linked to transfers of monies, small or large. Money, in that sense, can both powers, and also reward, crime. As noted by many scholars, with increasing globalization, an ideology and social construct, in which transactions across bor- ders are accomplished with little or no control over the quantum, and mode of transfer of money in exchange for various services an value rendered, both legal and illegal, nation-states also have begun to confront complex problem of cross- border crimes of all kinds’.
The worries of this court relate not merely due to the quantum of monies said to have been secreted away in foreign banks, but also the manner in which they many have been taken away from the country, and with the nature of activi- ties that may have engendered the accumulation of such monies.
Large amounts of unaccounted monies, stashed away in banks located in jurisdictions that thrive on strong privacy laws protecting bearers of those accounts to avoid scrutiny, raise each and every worry delineated above. First and foremost, such large monies stashed abroad, and unaccounted for by individuals and entities of a country, would suggest the necessity of suspecting that they have been generated in activities that have been deemed to be unlawful. In addition, such large amounts of unaccounted monies would also lead to a natural suspicion that they have been transferred out of the country is order to evade payment to taxes, thereby depleting the capacity of the nation to undertake many tasks that are in public interest.
Consequently, the issue of unaccounted monies held by nationals, and other legal entities, in foreign banks, is of primordial importance to the welfare of the citizens. The quantum of such monies may be tough indicators of the weak- ness of the State, in terms of both crime prevention, and also of tax collection.
When a catchall word like ‘crime’ is used, it is common for people, and the popular culture to assume that it is ‘petty crime’ or crimes of passion committed by individuals. That would be a gross mischaracterization of the seriousness of the issues involved. Far more dangerous are the crime that threaten national secu- rity, and national interest. For instance, with globalization, nation states are also
 
confronted in the dark worlds of international arms dealers, drug-peddlers, and various kinds of criminal networks, including networks of terror. International criminal networks that extend support to home-grown terror or extremist groups, or those that have been nurtured and sustained in hostile countries, depend on networks of formal and informal, lawful and unlawful mechanisms of transfer of monies across boundaries of nation-states. They work in the interstices of the microstructure of financial transfers across the global, and thrive in the lacunae, the gaps in law and of effort. The loosening of control over those mechanisms of transfers, guided by an extreme neoliberal thirst to create a global market that is free of the friction of law and its enforcement, by nation-states, may have also contributed to an increase in volume, extent and intensity of activities by criminal and terror networks across the globe.’

conclusIon
It can be seen that the money laundering process involves activities that are cross- border and has international ramifications. Hence, in order to curtail this act, it is necessary that all countries should enact strict laws and legislations that will pre- vent the launderers from carrying out such activities. Also, such legislations espe- cially in countries which are considered to be tax heavens can be a disincentive for the launderers and they will have no place to go. The international coopera- tion is lagging because there is no consensus on what constitutes a money laun- dering crime; therefore, it has been difficult to harmonize international efforts against the money laundering activities. Thus, steps have to be taken to devise measures that can be implemented across countries, keeping in mind that the money laundering process has transnational character.
The issue of confidentiality among the states is also a concern. Some of the jurisdictions do not want any kind of obligation under international treaty to disclose information regarding money laundering activities, especially related to disclosure of information from the National Bank. Thus, distinction has to be made between the confidentiality rules and usage of feature to carry out money laundering activities.
There is also a prevalent thought that the money laundering is a victimless crime. They are not aware of the ramifications of this crime. Firstly, the proceeds used for laundering comes from illegal and criminal activities, and secondly, such laundered money is once again used, purchase assets, etc., to build-up their crimi- nal empire. Hence, there is need to create awareness regarding the criminal nature of the money laundering activities, and such step will help in better understand- ing of the issue and effective enforcement.
Apart from this, there needs to be effective coordination between the Centre and the States. The implementation and enforcement should happen at both at the Centre level and at the State level, it should not only be considered as the responsibility of the Centre. Decentralized implementation mechanism can go a long way in curbing these activities. Thus, in order to have an effective anti- money laundering regime, one has to think locally, nationally and globally.
 

eu Directive of 2001 and paris Declaration of 2002
•	The European Union too has issued a new Money Laundering Directive in December 2001 to amend its earlier Directive of 1991, which already contained strong anti-money laundering measures which required financial institutions to know their customers, maintain appropriate records and establish anti-money laundering programmes.
•	The Directive of 2001 extends coverage to bureaux de change, money
transfer companies and investment firms. Definition of ‘criminal activity’ is also expanded to cover not only drug trafficking, but also all serious crimes including corruption and fraud against the EU.
•	The Directive significantly brings within its ambit lawyers, auditors,
accountants, tax advisers, real estate agents and notaries when they participate in the movement of money for their clients. They have to now report to the authorities any transaction that indicates laundering of money.

un convention and security council resolution
•	The UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism was proposed on 9 December 1999, which was open for signature from 10 January 2000 to 21 December 2001.
•	Subsequently, the convention has entered into force on 10 April 2002.
•	At present, 68 nations have ratified the convention.
•	The convention has a major shortcoming, as it does not provide for a monitoring agency to oversee enforcement of the convention.

usa patriot act of 2001
•	Lawmakers worldwide have felt that concerted efforts are required to deal with terrorist funding to tackle terrorism. The US Congress passed the USA Patriot Act of 2001 within 43 days of 11 September 2001, 26 October 2001. This Act made as many as 52 amendments to the existing Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). The scope of these new provisions touched every financial institution and business not only in the US, but also in most of the world.
•	One of the changes made in the BSA requires every financial institu-
tion to establish anti-money laundering programmes.
•	Moreover, the list of businesses now defined as financial institutions is wide ranging and includes banks, brokers and dealers in securities or commodities, currency exchanges, insurance companies, credit card operators, dealers in precious metals, stones and jewels, travel agen- cies, businesses engaged in the sale of vehicles including automobiles,
 

air planes and boats, casinos and gaming establishments, and even tele- graph companies and US postal service.
•	It also adds underground banking systems, such as ‘hawala’, to the defi-
nition of financial institutions. It creates customer identification and due diligence duties.
•	At the same time, it grants immunity to financial institutions and their
employees for sharing reports of suspicious activities with any govern- ment agency or with each other. It also makes it a crime to conceal more than US $ 10,000 in currency or monetary instruments while entering or leaving the US.
•	As a result, hundreds of thousands of financial institutions and busi-
nesses, who were not previously concerned about money laundering, now have to maintain anti-money laundering programmes requiring them to ‘develop internal policies, procedures and controls’, ‘desig- nate a compliance officer’, conduct ‘ongoing employee training pro- grammes’ and perform ‘independent audit functions’.
•	The US intelligence agencies can now have access to reports and
records of financial institutions and businesses including suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by them. One of the major changes is prohibition of correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks, which have no physical presence anywhere. A foreign bank must have a fixed address, employ at least one full-time employee, maintain operating records and be inspected by a banking authority to qualify for a cor- respondent account.
•	Apart from amending the BSA, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 also
made changes in the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986.
•	It now acquires extraterritorial jurisdiction to combat terrorist funding and criminal proceeds.
•	The law covered funds representing proceeds of nearly 200 specified
unlawful activities (SUAs) such as fraud, kidnapping, gambling, espio- nage, drug trafficking, etc. It now covers bribing of a foreign public official, embezzlement of public funds, smuggling or export control violations involving items covered by the Arms Export Control Act as well as crimes of violence.
