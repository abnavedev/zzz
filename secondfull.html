12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>At the hour of midnight on 14-15 August
1947, India attained independence. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister
of free India, addressed a special session of the Constituent Assembly that
night. This was the famous ‘tryst with destiny’ speech that you are familiar
with. This was the moment Indians had been waiting for. You are aware that
there were many voices in our national movement. But there were two goals
almost everyone agreed upon: one, that after Independence, we shall run our
country through democratic government; and two, that the government will be run
for the good of all, particularly the poor and the socially disadvantaged
groups. Now that the country was independent, the time had come to realise the
promise of freedom. </span></p>

born in very difficult circumstances. Perhaps no other country by then was born
in a situation more difficult than that of India in 1947. Freedom came with the
partition of the country. The year 1947 was a year of unprecedented violence
and trauma of displacement. It was in this situation that independent India
started on its journey to achieve several objectives. Yet the turmoil that
accompanied independence did not make our leaders lose sight of the multiple
challenges that faced the new nation. </span></p>

generations of patriots and the blood of countless martyrs had borne fruit. But
this joy was tainted by despair, for the country had been divided. Large parts
of the two new nations were engulfed by communal riots. There was a mass exodus
of people from both states across the new borders. There was scarcity of food
and other consumer goods, and a fear of administrative breakdown. </span></p>

territorial and administrative integration of the princely states, the communal
riots that accompanied Partition, the rehabilitation of nearly six million
refugees who had migrated from Pakistan, the protection of Muslims threatened
by communal gangs, the need to avoid war with Pakistan, and the Communist
insurgency. Restoration of law and order and political stability and putting in
place an administrative system, threatened with breakdown because of Partition
and the illogical division of the army and higher bureaucracy virtually on
religious lines, were other immediate tasks. As Nehru declared in 1947, ‘First
things must come first and the first thing is the security and stability of

problems of framing a constitution and building a representative democratic and
civil libertarian political order, organizing elections to put in place the
system of representative and responsible governments at the Centre and in the
states, and abolishing the semi-feudal agrarian order through thorough-going
land reforms. The newly-formed independent government also had the long-term
tasks of promoting national integration, pushing forward the process of
nation-in-the-making, facilitating rapid economic development, removing endemic
poverty, and initiation of the planning process. </span></p>

possible the gap between mass expectations aroused by the freedom struggle and
their fulfilment, to get rid of centuries-long social injustice, inequality,
and oppression, and to evolve a foreign policy which would defend Indian
independence and promote peace in a world increasingly engulfed by the Cold War
and getting divided into hostile power blocs. All these problems had to be
dealt with within the framework of the basic values to which the national
movement had been committed and within the parameters of a broad national
consensus. </span></p>

set out to handle these short-term and long-term problems fuelled by an
optimism, a certain faith in the country’s future and with a joie de vivre.
This mood was to persist for most of the Nehru years. Though many, especially
on the left, were dissatisfied with and basically critical of Nehru and his
policies, they too shared this feeling of hope. Those who have lived through
the Nehru era often now feel that they were lucky to have done so. Nehru
himself once again expressed this feeling after nearly a decade as prime
minister: ‘There is no lack of drama in this changing world of ours and, even
in India, we live in an exciting age. I have always considered it a great
privilege for people of this generation to live during this period of India’s
long history ... I have believed that there is nothing more exciting in the
wide world today than to work in India.’ Some of this euphoria disappeared with
the India-China war of 1962. The war brought in a degree of realism but even so
neither Nehru nor the country experienced any sense of defeatism. Nehru had
always believed that ‘India’s greatest need is for a sense of certainty
concerning her own success.’ And it was this sense of excitement and of the
coming success which he succeeded in imparting to the millions. </span></p>

leader who possessed a strong will and was decisive in action and strong in
administration. Then there were the learned Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the
erudite Rajendra Prasad, and C. Rajagopalachari, endowed with a razor-sharp
intellect. At the state level, were several leaders like Govind Ballabh Pant in

persons of total personal integrity and had an austere lifestyle. No finger was
ever pointed at Sardar Patel, for example, even as he performed the unenviable
but necessary task of gathering funds for the Congress from the rich. The
Congress leaders also shared a common vision of independent India. They were
committed to the goals of rapid social and economic change and democratization
of the society and polity, and the values imparted by the national movement.
Nehru’s commitment to these values is well known. But, in fact, Sardar Patel,
Rajendra Prasad and C. Rajagopalachari were equally committed to the values of
democracy, civil liberties, secularism, and independent economic development,
anti-imperialism, social reforms and had a pro-poor orientation. These leaders
differed with Nehru primarily on the question of socialism and class analysis
of society. We may point out, parenthetically, in this context that Patel has
been much misunderstood and misrepresented both by admirers and critics. </span></p>

right-wingers have used him to attack the Nehruvian vision and policies, while
his leftist critics have portrayed him as the archetypal rightist. Both,
however, have been wrong. In any case, it is important that Nehru and the other
leaders shared the belief that for the country’s development building-up of a
national consensus was necessary. The leadership’s position was strengthened by
the fact they enjoyed tremendous popularity and prestige among almost every
section of the people. On top of that, this team was headed by Jawaharlal Nehru
who exercised, after December 1950, unchallenged authority in the party and the
government. </span></p>

situation was the existence of Congress, a strong, democratically functioning,

margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>THE COLONIAL LEGACY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>India’s colonial past has weighed heavily
in her development since 1947. In the economic sphere, as in others, British
rule drastically transformed India. But the changes that took place led only to
what has been aptly described by A. Gunder Frank as the ‘development of
underdevelopment’. These changes —in agriculture, industry, transport and
communication, finance, administration, education, and so on—were in themselves
often positive, as for example the development of the railways. But operating
within and as part of the colonial framework, they became inseparable from the
process of underdevelopment. Further, they led to the crystallization of the
colonial economic structure which generated poverty, a dependence on and
subordination to Britain. There were four basic features of the colonial
structure in India. First, colonialism led to the complete but complex
integration of India’s economy with the world capitalist system but in a
subservient position. Since the 1750s, India’s economic interests were wholly
subordinated to those of Britain. This is a crucial aspect, for integration
with the world economy was inevitable and was a characteristic also of
independent economies. Second, to suit British industry, a peculiar structure
of production and international division of labour was forced upon India. It
produced and exported foodstuffs and raw materials—cotton, jute, oilseeds,
minerals—and imported manufactured products of British industry from biscuits
and shoes to machinery, cars and railway engines. </span></p>

<p class=Para1 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>6</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>This feature of colonialism continued
even when India developed a few labour-intensive industries such as jute and
cotton textiles. This was because of the existing, peculiar pattern of
international division of labour by which Britain produced high technology,
high productivity and capital-intensive goods while India did the opposite. The
pattern of India’s foreign trade was an indication of the economy’s colonial
character. As late as 1935-39, food, drink, tobacco and raw materials
constituted 68.5 per cent of India’s exports while manufactured goods were 64.4
per cent of her imports. Third, basic to the process of economic development is
the size and utilization of the economic surplus or savings generated in the
economy for investment and therefore expansion of the economy. The net savings
in the Indian economy from 1914 to 1946 was only 2.75 per cent of Gross
National Product (i.e., national income). The small size may be contrasted with
the net savings in 1971-75 when they constituted 12 per cent of GNP. The paltry
total capital formation, 6.75 per cent of GNP during 1914-46 as against 20.14
per cent of GNP during 1971-75, reflects this jump. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Moreover, the share of industry in this
low level of capital formation was abysmally low, machinery forming only 1.78
per cent of GNP during 1914-46. (This figure was 6.53 for 1971-75). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Furthermore, a large part of India’s
social surplus or savings was appropriated by the colonial state and misspent.
Another large part was appropriated by the indigenous landlords and
moneylenders. It has been calculated that by the end of the colonial period,
the rent and interest paid by the peasantry amounted to Rs 1400 million per
year. By 1937, the total rural debt amounted to Rs 18,000 million. According to

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The fourth feature of colonialism in India
was the crucial role played by the state in constructing, determin-ing and
maintaining other aspects of the colonial structure. India’s policies were
determined in Britain and in the interests of the British economy and the
British capitalist class. An important aspect of the underdevelopment of India
was the denial of state support to industry and agriculture. This was contrary
to what happened in nearly all the capitalist countries, including Britain,
which enjoyed active state support in the early stages of development. The
colonial state imposed free trade in India and refused to give tariff
protection to Indian industries as Britain, western Europe and the United
States had done. After 1918, under the pressure of the national movement, the
Government of India was forced to grant some tariff protection to a few
industries. But this was inadequate and ineffective. Moreover, since the 1880s,
the currency policy was manipulated by the government to favour British
industry and which was to the detriment of Indian industry. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>A very large part of India’s social
surplus was appropriated by the colonial state, but a very small part of it was
spent by it on the development of agriculture or industry or on social
infrastructure or nation-building activities such education, sanitation and
health services. The colonial state devoted almost its entire income to meeting
the needs of British-Indian administration, making payments of direct and
indirect tribute to Britain and in serving the needs of British trade and
industry. The bulk of public revenue was absorbed by military expenditure and
civil administration which was geared to maintenance of law and order and tax
collection. After 1890, military expenditure absorbed nearly 50 per cent of the
central government’s income. In 1947-48, this figure stood at nearly 47 per
cent. Besides, the Indian tax structure was highly inequitable. While the
peasants were burdened with paying a heavy land revenue for most of the
colonial period and the poor with the salt tax, etc., the upper income
groups—highly paid bureaucrats, landlords, merchants and traders—paid hardly
any taxes. The level of direct taxes was quite low. The number of income-tax
payers was only 360,000 in 1946-47. It was only under the pressure from the
national and <span class=0Text>7</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Colonialism became a fetter on India’s
agricultural and industrial development. Agriculture stagnated in most parts of
the country and even deteriorated over the years, resulting in extremely low
yields per acre, and sometimes even reaching zero. There was a decline in per
capita agricultural production which fell by 14 per cent between 1901 and 1941.
The fall in per capita foodgrains was even greater, being over 24 per cent.
Over the years, an agrarian structure evolved which was dominated by landlords,
moneylenders, merchants and the colonial state. Subinfeudation, tenancy and
share-cropping increasingly dominated both the zamindari and ryotwari areas. By
the forties, the landlords controlled over 70 per cent of the land and along
with the moneylenders and the colonial state appropriated more than half of the
total agricultural production. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The colonial state’s interest in
agriculture was primarily confined to collecting land revenue and it spent very
little on improving agriculture. Similarly, landlords and moneylenders found
rack-renting of tenants and sharecroppers and usury far more profitable and
safe than making productive investment in the land they owned or controlled.
All this was hardly conducive to agricultural development. In many areas, a
class of rich peasants developed as a result of commercialization and tenancy
legislation, but most of them too preferred to buy land and become landlords or
to turn to money lending. As a result capitalist farming was slow to develop
except in a few pockets. On the other hand, the impoverished cultivators, most
of them small peasants, tenants-at will and sharecroppers, had no resources or
incentive to invest in the improvement of agriculture by using better cattle
and seeds, more manure and fertilizers and improved techniques of production.
For most of the colonial period, landlessness had been rising, so that the
number of landless agricultural labourers grew from 13 per cent of the
agricultural population in 1871 to 28 per cent in 1951. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The increase in tenant-farming and
sharecropping and overcrowding of agriculture was followed by an extreme
subdivision of land into small holdings and fragmentation. Further, these
holdings were scattered into non-contiguous parcels and which led to
cultivation becoming uneconomic and incapable of maintaining the cultivator
even at a subsistence level. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Of course, the linkage with the world
market and development of roads and railways did lead to a large part of rural
produce entering the urban and world markets and to the production of
commercial crops. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, commercialization of agriculture
did not lead to capitalist farming or improved technology. Its chief result was
that better soil, available water and other resources were diverted from food
crops to commercial crops. At a time when agriculture in the developed
countries was being modernized and revo-lutionized, there was near absence of
change in the technological or production base of Indian agriculture. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Indian peasants continued to use the
primitive implements they had used for centuries. For example, in 1951, there
were only 930,000 iron ploughs in use while wooden ploughs numbered 31.3
million. The use of inorganic fertilizers was virtually unknown, while a large
part of animal manure—cow dung, night soil and cattle bones—was wasted. In
1938-39, only 11 per cent of all cropped land was under improved seeds, their
use being largely confined to non-food cash crops. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Agricultural education was completely
neglected. In 1946, there were only 9 agricultural colleges with 3,110
students. There was hardly any investment in terracing, flood-control, drainage,
and de-salination of soil. Irrigation was the only field in which some progress
was made so that by the forties nearly 27 per cent of the total cultivated area
was irrigated. But, then, India had always been quite advanced in irrigation
cultivation. Another central aspect of India’s economic backwardness was the
state of its industry. During the nineteenth century, there was a quick
collapse of Indian handicraft and artisanal industries largely because of the
competition from the cheaper imported manufactures from Britain together with
the policy of free trade imposed on India. The ruined artisans failed to find
alternative employment. The only choice open to them was to crowd into
agriculture as tenants, sharecroppers and agricultural labourers. Modern
industries did develop in India from the second half of the nineteenth century.

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>tion and employment, the level of
industrial development was stunted and paltry compared with that of the
developed countries. It did not compensate even for the handicraft industries
it displaced. Industrial development was mainly confined to cotton and jute and
tea in the nineteenth century and to sugar, cement and paper in the nineteen
thirties. There had been some development of the iron and steel industry after
1907, but as late as 1946, cotton and jute textiles accounted for nearly 30 per
cent of all workers employed in factories and more than 55 per cent of the
total value added by manufacturing. The share of modern industries in national
income at the end of British rule was only 7.5 per cent. India also lagged in
the development of electric power. Similarly, modern banking and insurance were
grossly underdeveloped. An important index of India’s industrial backwardness
and economic dependence on the metropolis was the virtual absence of capital
goods and machine industries. In 1950, India met about 90 per cent of its needs
of machine tools through imports. The underdeveloped character of this modern
part of the economy can be seen by comparing certain economic statistics for
1950 and 1984 (the figures for 1984 are given within brackets). In 1950 India
produced 1.04 million tons of steel (6.9 million tons), 32.8 million tons of
coal (155.2 million tons), 2.7 million tons of cement (29.9 million tons), 3
million rupees worth of machine tools and portable tools (3,28 million rupees),
7 locomotives (200), 99,000 bicycles (5,944,000), 14 million electrical lamps
(317.8 million), 33,000 sewing machines (338,000), and it generated 14 kwh
electricity per capita (160 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

and branches was 5,072; in 1983 the figure had risen to 33,055. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In 1950, out of a population of 357

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Another index of economic backwardness
was the high rural-urban ratio of India’s population because of growing
dependence on agriculture. In 1951, nearly 82.3 per cent of the population was
rural. While in 1901, 63.7 per cent of Indians had depended on agriculture, by
1941 this figure had gone up to 70. On the other hand the number of persons
engaged in processing and manufacturing fell from 10.3 million in 1901 </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>to 8.8 million in 1951 even though the
population increased by nearly 40 per cent. Till the late thirties, foreign
capital dominated the industrial and financial fields and controlled foreign
trade as also part of the internal trade that fed into exports. British firms
dominated coal mining, the jute industry, shipping, banking and insurance, and
tea and coffee plantations. Moreover, through their managing agencies, the
British capitalists controlled many of the Indian owned companies. It may be
added that many of the negative effects of foreign capital arose out of the
state power being under alien control. Lopsided industrial development was yet
another striking feature. Industries were concentrated only in a few regions
and cities of the country. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>This not only led to wide regional
disparities in income but also affected the level of regional integration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>But there were some major changes that
occurred in the Indian economy, especially during the thirties and forties that
did impart a certain strength to it and provided a base for post-independence
economic development. One positive feature was the growth of the means of
transport and communication. In the forties, India had 65,000 miles of paved
roads and nearly 42,000 miles of railway track. Roads and railways unified the
country and made rapid transit of goods and persons possible. However, in the
absence of a simultaneous industrial revolution, only a commercial revolution
was produced which further colonialized the Indian economy. Also the railway
lines were laid primarily with a view to link India’s inland raw
material-producing areas with the ports of export and to promote the spread of
imported manufactures from the ports to the interior. The needs of Indian
industries with regard to their markets and sources of raw materials were
neglected as no steps were taken to encourage traffic between inland centres. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The railway freight rates were also so
fixed as to favour imports and exports and to discriminate against internal
movement of goods. Moreover, unlike in Britain and the United States, railways
did not initiate steel and machine industries in India. Instead, it was the British
steel and machine industries which were the beneficiaries of railway
development in India. The Government of India also established an efficient and
modern postal and telegraph system, though the telephone system remained
underdeveloped. Another important feature was the development of the small but
Indian owned industrial base. It consisted of several consumer industries such
cotton and jute textiles, sugar, soap, paper and matches. Some intermediate
capital goods industries such as iron and steel, cement, basic chemicals,
metallurgy and engineering had also begun to come up, but on a paltry scale. By
1947, India already possessed a core of scientific and technical manpower, even
though facilities for technical education were grossly inadequate, there being
only 7 engineering colleges with 2,217 students in the country in 1939. Also,
most of the managerial and <span class=0Text>9</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>technical personnel in industry were
non-Indian. There was also, after 1914, the rise of a strong indigenous
capitalist class with an independent economic and financial base. The Indian
capitalists were, in the main, independent of foreign capital. Unlike in many
other colonial countries, they were not intermediaries or middlemen between
foreign capital and the Indian market, or junior partners in foreign-controlled
enterprises. They were also perhaps more enterprising than the foreign
capitalists in India, with the result that investment under Indian capital grew
considerably faster than British and other foreign investment. By the end of
World War II, Indian capital controlled 60 per cent of the large industrial
units. The small-scale industrial sector, which generated more national income
than the large-scale sector, was almost wholly based on Indian capital. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>By 1947, Indian capital had also made a
great deal of headway in banking and life insurance. Indian joint-stock banks
held 64 cent of all bank deposits, and Indian-owned life insurance companies
controlled nearly 75 per cent of life insurance business in the country. The
bulk of internal trade and part of foreign trade was also in Indian hands.
These positive features of the Indian economy have, however, to be seen in a
wider historical context. First, the development of Indian industry and
capitalism was still relatively stunted and severely limited. Then, occurring
within the framework of a colonial economy, this industrialization took place
without India undergoing an industrial revolution as Britain did. The economy
did not take-off. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Whatever development occurred was not
because of, but inspite of colonialism and often in opposition to colonial
policies. It was the result of intense economic and political struggle against
colonialism in the context of Britain’s declining position in the world economy
and the two world wars and the Great Depression of the thirties. Lastly,
fuller, unfettered or autonomous economic development or take-off could not
have taken place without a break with and destructuring of colonialism. The end
result of colonial underdevelopment was the pauperization of the people,
especially the peasantry and the artisans. Extreme and visible poverty, disease
and hunger and starvation were the lot of the ordinary people. This found
culmination in a series of major famines which ravaged all parts of India in
the second half of the nineteenth century; there were regular scarcities and
minor famines in one or the other part of the country throughout British rule. </span></p>

century, per capita income had stagnated if not declined. During 1941-50, the
annual death rate was 25 per 1,000 </span></p>

was between 175 and 190 per 1,000 live births. An average Indian born between
1940 and 1951 could expect to live for barely thirty-two years. Epidemics like
small pox, plague and cholera and diseases like dysentery, diarrhoea, malaria
and other fevers carried away millions every year. Malaria alone affected
one-fourth of the population. Health services were dismal. In 1943, there were
only 10 medical colleges turning out 700 graduates every year and 27 medical
schools turning out nearly 7,000 licentiates. In 1951, there were only about
18,000 graduate doctors, most of them to be found in cities. The number of
hospitals was 1,915 with 1, 16,731 beds and of dispensaries 6,589, with 7,072 </span></p>

modern sanitation and large parts of even those cities which did, were kept out
of the system, modern sanitation being confined to areas where the Europeans
and rich Indians lived. A modern water supply system was unknown in villages
and absent in a large number of towns. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

century it was fully recognized that education was a crucial input and economic
development, but the vast majority of Indians had almost no access to any kind
of education and, in 1951, nearly 84 per cent were illiterate, the rate of
illiteracy being 92 per cent among women. There were only 13,590 middle schools
and 7,288 high schools. These figures do not adequately reflect the state of
the vast majority of Indians, for they ignore the prevalence of the extreme
inequality of income, resources and opportunities. A vast human potential was
thereby left untapped in societal development for very few from the poorer
sections of society were able to rise, to its middle and upper levels. It is
also to be noted that a high rate of population growth was not responsible for
the poverty and impoverishment, for it had been only about 0.6 per cent per
year between 1871 and 1941. Thus, a stagnating per capita income, abysmal
standards of living, stunted industrial development and stagnating,
low-productivity; semi-feudal agriculture marked the economic legacy of
colonialism as it neared the end. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The British evolved a general educational
system, based on English as the common language of higher education, for the
entire country. This system in time produced an India-wide intelligentsia which
tended to have a similar approach to society and common ways of looking at it
and which was, at its best, capable of developing a critique of colonialism—and
this it did during the second half of the nineteenth century and after. But
English-based education had two extremely negative consequences. One, it
created a wide gulf between the educated and the masses. Though this gulf was
bridged to some extent by the national movement which drew its leaders as well
its cadres from the intelligentsia, it still persisted to haunt independent
India. Second, the emphasis on English prevented the fuller development of Indian
languages as also the spread of education to the masses. The colonial
educational system, otherwise also suffered from many weaknesses which still
pervade India’s schools and colleges. It encouraged learning by rote,
memori-zation of texts, and proof by authority. The rational, logical,
analytical and critical faculties of the students remained underdeveloped; in
most cases they could reproduce others’ opinions but had difficulty in
formulating their own. A major weakness of the colonial educational system was
the neglect of mass education as also of scientific and technical education.
There was also the almost total lack of concern for the education of girls, so
that in 1951 only eight out of 100 women in India were literate. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The character of the colonial state was
quite paradoxical. While it was basically authoritarian and autocratic, it also
featured certain liberal elements, like the rule of law and a relatively
independent judiciary. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The administration was normally carried
out in obedience to laws interpreted by the courts. This acted as a partial
check on the autocratic and arbitrary administration and to a certain extent
protected the rights and liberties of a citizen against the arbitrary actions
of the bureaucracy. The laws were, however, often repressive. Not being framed
by Indians, and through a democratic process, they left a great deal of
arbitrary power in the hands of the civil servants and the police. There was
also no separation of powers between administrative and judicial functions. The
same civil servant administered a district as collector and dispensed justice
as a district magistrate. The colonial legal system was based on the concept of
equality of all before the law irrespective of a person’s caste, religion,
class or status, but here too it fell short of its promise. The court acted in
a biased manner whenever effort was made to bring an European to justice.
Besides, as court procedures were quite costly, the rich had better access to
legal means than the poor. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Colonial rulers also extended a certain
amount of civil liberties in the form of the freedoms of the Press, speech and
association in normal times, but curtailed them drastically in periods of mass
struggle. But after 1897, these freedoms were increasingly tampered with and
attacked even in normal times. Another paradox of the colonial state was that
after 1858 it regularly offered constitutional and economic concessions while
throughout retaining the reins of state power. At first, British statesmen and
administrators strongly and consistently resisted the idea of establishing a
representative regime in India, arguing that democracy was not suited to India.
They said only a system of ‘benevolent despotism’ was advisable because of
India’s culture and historical heritage. But under Indian pressure, elections
and legislatures were introduced both at the Centre and in the provinces.
Nevertheless, the franchise, or the right to vote, was extremely narrow. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Only about 3 per cent Indians could vote
after 1919, and about 15 per cent after 1935. The government thus hoped to
co-opt and thereby weaken the national movement and use the constitutional
structure to maintain its political domination. The legislatures, however, did
not enjoy much power till 1935 and even then supreme power resided with the
British. The government could take any action without the approval of the
legislatures and, in fact, could do what it liked, when it liked. But the
legislators did have the possibility to expose the basic, authoritarian
character of the government and the hollowness of colonial constitutional
reforms. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The legislatures did, however, provide
some Indians experience of participating in elections at various levels and
working in elected organs. This experience was useful after 1947 when Indians
acquired representative institutions. Meanwhile, the nationalists used the
constitutional space in conjunction with mass struggles and intense political,
ideological campaigns to overthrow colonial rule. The colonial legacy about the
unity of India was marked by a strange paradox. The colonial state brought
about a greater political and administrative unification of India than ever
achieved before. Building on the Mughal administrative system, it established a
uniform system which penetrated the country’s remotest areas and created a
single administrative entity. The British also evolved a common educational
structure which in time produced an India-wide intelligentsia which shared a
common outlook on society and polity, and thought in national terms. Combined
with the formation of a unified economy and the development of modern means of
communication, colonialism helped lay the basis for making of the Indian
nation. But having unified India, the British set into motion contrary forces.
Fearing the unity of the Indian people to which their own rule had contributed,
they followed the classic imperial policy of divide and rule. The diverse and
divisive features of Indian society and polity were heightened to promote
cleavages among the people and to turn province against province, caste against
caste, class against class, Hindus against Muslims, and the princes and
landlords against the national movement. They succeeded in their endeavours to
a varying extent, which culminated in India’s Partition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The British ruled India through a modern
bureaucracy headed by the highly-paid Indian Civil Service (ICS) whose members
were recruited through merit based on open competition. The bureaucracy was
rule-bound, efficient and, at the top, rather honest. Following Indian pressure
the different services were gradually Indianized after 1918—by 1947, nearly 48
per cent of the members of the ICS were Indian—but positions of control and
authority were up to the end retained by the British. Indians in these services
too functioned as agents of British rule. Though their senior echelons developed
certain traditions of independence, integrity, hard work, and subordination to
higher political direction they also came to form a rigid and exclusive caste,
often having a conservative and narrow social, economic and political outlook.
When massive social change and economic development was sought after 1947, the
rigidity and the outlook of the bureaucracy became a major obstacle. While the
ICS was more or less free of corruption, it flourished at the lower levels of
administration, especially in departments where there was scope for it, such as

During the Second World War, because of government regulation and controls,
corruption and black marketing spread on a much wider scale in the
administration as also did tax evasion, once rates of income tax and excise
were revised to very high levels. There was also the rise of the parallel,

prevented from reaching the soldiers’ and officers’ messes. The other side of

debt of gratitude to the vision, tact, diplomacy and pragmatic approach of
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the indomitable man who integrated 562 princely
states with the Union of India and prevented the Balkanisation of the
newly-independent country. Back in 1947, India had finally gained a hard-fought
independence but it had come with besetting problems — partition, communal
riots and a refugee crisis. Add to that crippling resource constraint,
fledgling institutions and an ill-equipped colonial machinery and it’s not
difficult to understand why India’s new government found the integration of
more than 500 princely states a tough nut to crack. Patel, India’s first deputy
prime minister and the minister of home affairs, would not just handle these
problems with deftness and dexterity but would go on to truly become the
“Architect of Modern India”. </span></p>

man of few words but when he did talk, people listened. This is why he was
given the formidable task of integrating the princely states as India’s first
deputy prime minister and home minister. With the swiftness of a military
commander and skill of an innate diplomat, he got to work, ably assisted by
V.P. Menon (then the Constitutional Adviser to Lord Mountbatten and later, the
secretary of the Ministry of the States). Back then, the princely states
covered 48% of the area of pre-Independent India and constituted 28% of its
population. While these kingdoms were not legally a part of British India, in
reality, they were completely subordinate to the British Crown. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Indian Independence Act of 1947
(based on the Mountbatten Plan) provided for the lapse of paramountcy of the
British Crown over the Indian states. It also gave each of these rulers the
option to accede to the newly born dominions India or Pakistan or continue as
an independent sovereign state. Realising the need to get these 500-odd
chiefdoms to accede to India before the day of independence, Patel and Menon
began using all the tricks in the bag — including the use of both force and
friendly advice — to achieve their integration with the Indian dominion. But
the process was far from simple. Mollycoddled as well as exploited by the
British for decades, many of the rulers saw the departure of the British as the
ideal moment to declare autonomy and announce their independent statehood on
the world map. However, the brilliant team of Patel (who laid out the
framework) and Menon (who did the actual groundwork) persevered. </span></p>

threw a series of lunch parties, where he urged his princely guests to help the
Congress in framing a new constitution of India. Patel’s tireless efforts paid
off when most of the rulers agreed to the dissolution of their respective
states, surrendering control of thousands of villages, jagirs, palaces,
institutes, cash balances amounting to crores and a railway system of about
12,000 miles to the Indian government without receiving any compensation. By 15
August 1947, the process of integration of princely states was almost complete
except for a few, who held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of
Accession — like Piploda, a small state in central India that did not accede to
India until March 1948. The biggest problems, however, arose with Jodhpur,
which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which
actually did accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, both of which

manufacturing and importing, the princely state was allowed to accede to
Pakistan on any terms it chose. Seeing the risks in the border state acceding
to Pakistan, Patel immediately met Hanvant Singh and assured him that importing
arms would be allowed, that Jodhpur would be connected to Kathiawar by rail and
that India would supply grain to it during famines. After the carrots, came the
stick in the form of more important warnings — it was pointed out that the
accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the basic
tenet of the two-nation theory and was very likely to cause communal violence
in the State. Thus, Jinnah’s blank cheque was quickly negated and Jodhpur acceded
to India. </span></p>

India is the ‘unity of spirit.’ Elements of political, administrative and
economic unity had developed especially under the Mughals. The politics of the
rulers and their territorial ambitions often cut across regions and were, at
their most ambitious, sub-continental in their reach. Also, despite backward
means of transport and communication, a great deal of India wide trade,
specialization of production and credit networks developed, especially during
the late medieval period. A feeling of Indianness, however vague, had come into
being, as testified by the currency of the concepts of Bharat Varsha and
Hindustan. As pointed out in an earlier chapter, the colonialization of Indian
economy, society and polity further strengthened the process of India’s
unification. From the middle of the nineteenth century, Indians were more and
more sharing common economic and political interests and social and cultural
development even though they continued to be differentiated by language and
ethnicity. </span></p>

role in welding Indians together politically and emotionally into a nation and
integrating them into ‘a common framework of political identity and loyalty.’
The depth, dura-tion and deep social penetration of this movement carried the
feeling of unity and nationhood to the mass of the people. The leaders of the
national movement realized that the making of the nation was a prolonged and
continuous process, and which was open to continuous challenges and
interruption, disruption and even reversal. One such disruption had already
occurred in 1947. As founders of the Republic, these leaders were therefore
fully aware that after independence too the process of unifying India and
national integration was to be carefully sustained, promoted and nurtured
through ideological and political endeavours. In fact, the leaders of India
after 1947 saw the preservation and consolidation of India’s unity as their
biggest challenge. As Nehru put it in 1952, ‘the most important factor, the
overriding factor, is the unity of India.’1 </span></p>

foundation. India could be unified and its segmenta-tion overcome only by
accepting this immense diversity and not counterposing it to the process of
nation-in-the-making. The emergence of a strong national identity and the
preservation of India’s rich diversity were seen as simultaneous processes.
Regional cultural identities would develop not in conflict with but as part of
the all-India identity. This entire outlook was epitomized in Nehru’s approach

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>It was, however, recognized that the
diversity of India could also be a source of weakness. Diversity could be used
for divisive purposes and transformed into disruptive tendencies, such as
communalism, casteism, linguist, and regional exclusiveness. The problem of
integrating diverse loyalties was therefore quite real, especially as rapid
social changes led to increase in the scale and number of social conflicts. The
issues of jobs, educational opportunities, access to political power and share
in the larger economic cake could and did fuel rivalries and conflicts based on
religion, region, caste, and language. Special efforts were necessary,
different from those in other parts of the world, to carefully promote national
unity. The broad strategy for national consolidation after 1947 involved
territorial integration, mobilization of political and institutional resources,
economic development, adoption of policies which would promote social justice,
remove glaring inequalities and provide equal opportunities. The leadership evolved
a political institutional structure conducive to national consolidation. At the
heart of this structure lay the inauguration of a democratic and civil
libertarian polity. The argument was rejected that democracy and national
integration were not compatible in case of newly liberated and developing
countries, and that an authorian political structure was needed to hold
together such a diverse nation as India. On the contrary, precisely because
India was so diverse it needed democracy rather than force or coercion to bind
it. Nehru repeatedly warned his countrymen that in India ‘any reversal of
democratic methods might lead to disruption and violence.’ India, he
underlined, could only be held together by a democratic structure with full
freedom as also opportunity for the diverse socioeconomic, cultural and
political voices to express themselves. The constitutional structure
established in 1950 encompassed the demands of diversity as well as the
requirements of unity. It provided for a federal structure with a strong Centre
but also a great deal of autonomy for the states. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The makers of the Constitution kept in
view the difference between decentralization and disintegration and between
unity and integration and centralization. The constitutional structure was not
only conducive to national integration but provided the basic framework within
which the struggle against divisive forces could be carried on. The political
leadership was to use elections both to promote national consolidation and to
legitimize its policies of integration. The parliament was the institution
where basic and ultimate power resided and which acted as the open arena where
different political trends could express themselves as also contend for power.
Invariably, the issues and problems, as also programmes and policies, debated
there were all-India in scale. As Asoka Mehta put it, the parliament acted as
the great unifier of the nation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Also, political parties acted as a great
integrating force. All the major post-1947 political parties—Socialist party,
Communist Party of India, the Jan Sangh and later the Swatantra party—were
all-India in character and in their organization and ideology; they stood for
the unity of the country. They strove for national goals and mobilized people
on an all-India basis and on all-India issues even when their capacity to do so
was limited to particular regions. All this was perhaps even more true of
Congress in the post-independence years. It had a strong and large organization
covering almost all parts of the country. It was able to maintain internal
party coherence and unity, and was also willing to play the role of a cementing
force in society and polity. It is important to remember that immediately after
independence, with the rapid marginalization of the communal parties, the major
divide in Indian politics and among the intelligentsia was on political and
ideological grounds rather than on the basis of caste, religion or language. It
is also significant that the major vocal social groups and classes—the
bourgeoisie, the working class and the intelligentsia—were all-India in outlook
and stood for national unity Indian nationalism, both before and after
independence, had little difficulty in coming to terms with the emerging class
consciousness as also class organizations such as trade unions and Kisan Sabhas
on one side and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) on
the other. No section of Indian society or polity saw loyalty to a class or
class organizations as threatening national cohesion. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The role of the leadership and its manner
of functioning in nation-making and national consolidation is quite important.
The leaders of the national movement thought in national terms and were fully
committed to national unity and consolidation, and this commitment was widely
accepted. Further, the prominent leaders of independent India—Jawaharlal Nehru,
Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Rajendra Prasad—were not associated with any one
region, language, religion, or caste. This was also true of the prominent
opposition leaders such as Jayaprakash Narayan, J.B. Kripalani, Rammanohar
Lohia, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, B.T. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>A major asset of the Congress leadership
was that it was well-versed in accommodative politics. It had been able to keep
united diverse political and ideological trends during the anti-imperialist
struggle. Following this, after 1947, despite near total political dominance,
it was willing to conciliate and accommodate, to listen to and appease the
opposition parties and dissenting groups. In particular, it was quite sensitive
to popular rumblings on linguistic or other cultural issues. Reacting strongly
to violence, it responded, often sympathetically, to demands pressed through
non-violent means and mass backing. Nehru, for example, was willing to persuade
and accommodate the Communists once they gave up recourse to violence. Other
political parties too, including the CPI, came to share after some time the
same means, methods and values for resolving social conflicts, differing only
in rhetoric. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Indian army and administrative
services were also a force for forging national unity. India developed after
1947 a national administrative service with recruitment to its top echelons,
the IAS, the IPS, and other central services, taking place on the basis of
individual merit, irrespective of caste or religion, from all regions and
linguistic areas. These services were all-India in character and sentiment and
all officers selected were given common training and owed allegiance to the
central government, which also had the ultimate power to promote or discipline
them. The central services, as also the state services, were basically
non-political and accepted the authority of the party which was voted to power
by the people. Likewise, the army was a national force whose officers and ranks
were recruited from all parts of the country. The Indian economy, national
market, and transport and communication networks were further unified after
1947. </span></p>

set up a Planning Commission and took active measures for planned economic
development. Though the government and the Planning Commission did not succeed
in putting an end to regional economic disparities; they did avoid inequality
in the distribution of economic resources among states. In general, the central
government followed accommodative policies towards the states. Consequently,
though there was constant grumbling and plenty of grievances there was no
serious discontent in the states and regions on grounds of discrimination by
the central government and therefore no separatist feelings on that account. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>National integration also required
policies which would promote social justice and greater social and economic
equality. The national movement had also linked the process of
nation-in-the-making with socio-economic changes in the interests of the
oppressed and the deprived. Consolidation of the nation after independence had
to be judged in terms of how it affected their lives. The entire Indian people
and not merely the middle and upper classes had to benefit from the coming of
independence and processes of economic development and political democracy. The
Constitution laid the basis for reduction of social disparity by putting an end
to any discrimination on grounds of religion caste or sex. Redeeming the
national movement’s major pledge to the depressed sections of society, it
provided reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in educational
institutions, employment and in the legislatures. Soon after 1947, a number of
social reforms and welfare laws were passed. Landlordism was abolished and
there was some redistribution of land. A law was passed making untouchability
an offence. Unfortunately, no struggle against the hierarchical caste system
followed, so that, on the one hand caste discrimination and oppression
continued, on the other, casteism or the use of caste solidarity for electoral
and other political purposes began to grow. The momentum of social reform was
lost by the early fifties. Removal of social oppression and social
discrimination and exploitation, based on caste, religion, language or
ethnicity, and of gross economic inequality has remained the weakest part of
the agenda for national integration. </span></p>

stood for secularism as the basis for the nation. Undaunted by Partition and
the accompanying riots, they remained loyal to the secular vision of the

whole succeeded in protecting the religious minorities. Independent India’s
foreign policy served as another unifying force. The policy of non-alignment
and anti-colonialism and Nehru’s growing stature as a world figure contributed
to a sense of national pride in India among all sections of people all over the
country and irrespective of their political alignment. At the moment of freedom
the need for unity was urgent but also present was the problem of integrating
diverse loyalties. The strategies and approaches promoting integration required
time but the people were in a hur-ry and there was plenty of scope for
conflicts. Many observers, infact, predicted growing disunity and even break-up
of the country. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The language problem was the most
divisive issue in the first twenty years of independent India, and it created
the apprehension among many that the political and cultural unity of the
country was in danger. People love their language; it is an integral part of
culture. Consequently, linguistic identity has been a strong force in all
societies. This is even more true of a multilingual society like India’s.
Linguistic diversity would inevitably give birth to strong political currents
around issues linked to language, such as educational and economic development,
job and other economic opportunities and access to political power. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Indian Constitution recognizes
sixteen major languages, including English and Sanskrit. In addition, there are
a myriad languages spoken by the tribals and others, with or without their own

in any case impossible in a democratic polity. The feasible option is to accept
and live with this ‘multiplicity’ in a manner that conflict situations do not

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The controversy on the language issue
became most virulent when it took the form of opposition to Hindi and tended to
create conflict between Hindi-speaking and non-Hindi speaking regions of the
country. The dispute was not over the question of a national language that is
one language which all Indians would adopt after some time, since the view that
one national language was essential to an Indian national identity had already
been rejected overwhelmingly by the secular majority of the national
leadership. India was a multilingual country and it had to remain so. The
Indian national movement had carried on its ideological and political work
through the different Indian regional languages. Its demand then was for the
replacement of English by the mother tongue as the medium for higher education,
administration and courts in each linguistic area. Jawaharlal Nehru had clearly
put across this view in 1937: ‘Our great provincial languages … </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>are ancient languages with a rich
inheritance, each spoken by many millions of persons, each tied up
inex-tricably with the life and culture and ideas of the masses as well as of
the upper classes. It is axiomatic that the masses can only grow educationally
and culturally through the medium of their own language. There-22</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>fore, it is inevitable that we lay stress
on the provincial languages and carry on most of our work through them … Our
system of education and public work must therefore be based on the provincial
languages.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The issue of a national language was
resolved when the Constitution makers virtually accepted all the major
languages as ‘languages of India’ or India’s national languages. But the matter
could not end there, for the country’s official work could not be carried on in
so many languages. There had to be one common language in which the central
government would carry on its work and maintain contact with the state governments.
The question arose what would be this language of all-India communication? Or
what would be India’s official and link language? Only two candidates were
available for the purpose: English and Hindi. The Constituent Assembly heatedly
debated which one should be selected. But, in fact, the choice had already been
made in the pre-independence period by the leadership of the national movement,
which was convinced that English would not continue to be the all-India medium
of communication in free India. For example, even while appreciating the value
of English as a world language, through which Indians could access world
science and culture and modern western ideas, Gandhiji was convinced that the
genius of a people could not unfold nor could their culture flower in a foreign
language. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In fact, Gandhiji, during the twenties
emphasized that English is ‘a language of international commerce, it is the
language of diplomacy, it contains many a rich literary treasure, and it gives
us an introduction to Western thought and culture.’ But he argued English
occupied in India ‘an unnatural place due to our unequal relations with
Englishmen.’6 English ‘has sapped the energy of the nation … it has estranged
them from the masses … The sooner therefore educated India shakes itself free
from the hypnotic spell of the foreign medium, the better it would be for them
and the people.’ And he wrote in 1946: ‘I love the English tongue in its own
place, but I am its inveterate opponent if it usurps a place which does not belong
to it. English is today admittedly the world language. I would therefore accord
it a place as a second, optional language.’ Nehru echoed these sentiments in
his 1937 article on ‘The Question of Language’ and also during the Constituent
Assembly debates. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Hindi or Hindustani, the other candidate
for the status of the official or link language, had already played this role
during the nationalist struggle, especially during the phase of mass
mobilization. Hindi had been accepted by leaders from non-Hindi speaking
regions because it was considered to be the most widely spoken and understood
language in the country. Lokamanya Tilak, Gandhiji, C. Rajagopalachari, Subhas
Bose, and Sardar Patel were some of Hindi’s enthusiastic supporters. In its
sessions and political work, the Congress had substituted Hindi and the
provincial languages in place of English. In 1925, Congress amended its
constitution to read: ‘The proceedings of the Congress shall be conducted as
far as possible in Hindustani. The English language or any provincial language
may be used if the speaker is unable to speak Hindustani or whenever necessary.
The proceedings of the Provincial Congress Committee shall ordinarily be
conducted in the language of the Province concerned. Hindustani may also be used.’
Reflecting a national consensus, the Nehru Report had laid down in 1928 that
Hindustani which might be written in Devanagari or Urdu script would be the
common language of India, but the use of English would be continued for some
time. It is interesting that ultimately the Constitution of free India was to
adopt this stand, except for replacing Hindustani by Hindi. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The real debate in the Constituent
Assembly occurred over two questions: Would Hindi or Hindustani replace
English? And what would be the timeframe for such a replacement to happen?
Sharp differences marked the initial debates as the problem of the official

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The question of Hindi or Hindustani was
soon resolved, though with a great deal of acrimony. Gandhiji and Nehru both
supported Hindustani, written in Devnagari or Urdu script. Though many
supporters of Hindi disagreed, they had tended to accept the Gandhi-Nehru
viewpoint. But once the Partition was announced, these champions of Hindi were
emboldened, especially as the protagonists of Pakistan had claimed Urdu as the
language of Muslims and of Pakistan. The votaries of Hindi now branded Urdu ‘as
a symbol of secession’. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

down the middle. In the end the Congress Legislative Party decided for Hindi
against Hindustani by 78 to 77 votes, even though Nehru and Azad fought for

Hindi would be the official and not the national language. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The issue of the time-frame for a shift
from English to Hindi produced a divide between Hindi and non-Hindi areas. The
spokespersons of Hindi areas were for the immediate switchover to Hindi, while
those from non-Hindi areas advocated retention of English for a long if not
indefinite period. In fact, they wanted the status quo to continue till a
future parliament decided to shift to Hindi as the official language. Nehru was
for making Hindi the official language, but he also was in favour of English
continuing as an additional official language, making the transition to Hindi
gradual, and actively encouraging the knowledge of English because of its
usefulness in the contemporary world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The case for Hindi basically rested on
the fact that it was the language of the largest number, though not of the
majority, of the people of India; it was also understood at least in the urban
areas of most of northern India from Bengal to Punjab and in Maharashtra and
Gujarat. The critics of Hindi talked about it being less developed than other
languages as a literary language and as a language of science and politics. But
their main fear was that Hindi’s adoption as the official language would place
non-Hindi areas, especially South India, at a disadvantage in the educational
and economic spheres, and particularly in competition for appointments in
government and the public sector. Such opponents tended to argue that
imposition of Hindi on non-Hindi areas would lead to their economic, political,
social and cultural domination by Hindi areas. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Constitution-makers were aware that
as the leaders of a multi-lingual country they could not ignore, or even give
the impression of ignoring, the interest of any one linguistic area. A
compromise was arrived at, though this led to the language provisions of the
Constitution becoming ‘complicated, ambiguous and confusing in some respects.’
The Constitution provided that Hindi in Devnagari script with international
numerals would be India’s official language. English was to continue for use in
all official purposes till 1965, when it would be replaced by Hindi. Hindi was
to be introduced in a phased manner. After 1965 it would become the sole
official language. However, the parliament would have the power to provide for
the use of English for specified purposes even after 1965. The Constitution
laid upon the government the duty to promote the spread and development of
Hindi and provided for the appointment of a Commission and a Joint Committee of
the Parliament to review the progress in this respect. The state legislatures
were to decide the matter of official language at the state level, though the
official language of the Union would serve as the language of communication
between the states and the Centre and between one state and another.
Implementation of the language provisions of the Constitution proved to be a
formidable task even though the Congress party was in power all over the
country. The issue remained a subject of intense controversy, and which became
increasingly acrimonious with passage of time, though for many years nobody
challenged the provision that Hindi would eventually, become the sole official
language. </span></p>

1965 the Hindi protagonists would overcome the weaknesses of Hindi, win the
confidence of non-Hindi areas, and hold their hand for a longer period till
such time they had done so. It was also hoped that with the rapid growth of
education Hindi too would spread and resistance to Hindi would gradually weaken
and even disappear. But, unfortunately, the spread of education was too slow to
make an impact in this respect. Moreover, the chances of Hindi’s success as an
official language were spoilt by the proponents of Hindi themselves. Instead of
taking up a gradual, slow and moderate approach to gain acceptance of Hindi by
non-Hindi areas and to rely on persuasion, the more fanatics among them,
preferred imposition of Hindi through government action. Their zeal and
enthusiasm tended to provoke a counter-movement. As Nehru told the parliament
in 1959, it was their over-enthusiasm which came in the way of the spread and
acceptance of Hindi for ‘the way they approach this subject often irritates
others, as it irritates me.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

science and scientific writing. In the fifties, for example there were hardly
any academic journals in Hindi outside the literary field. Instead of
developing Hindi as a means of communication in higher education, journalism,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

major weakness of the Hindi protagonists was that, instead of developing a
simple standard language which would get wide acceptance or at least popularize
the colloquial Hindi as spoken and written in Hindi areas as also in many other
parts of India, they tried to Sanskritize the language, replacing commonly
understood words with newly manufactured, unwieldy and little understood ones in
the name of the ‘purity’ of language, free of alien influences. This made it
more and more difficult for non-Hindi speakers (or even Hindi speakers) to
understand or learn the new version. All India Radio, which could have played
an important role in popularizing Hindi, instead took to so Sanskritizing its
Hindi news bulletins that many listeners would switch off their radios when the
Hindi news was broadcast. Nehru, a Hindi speaker and writer, was to complain in
1958 that he was unable to understand the language in which his own Hindi
speeches were being broadcast. But the purifiers of Hindi did not relent and
resisted all attempts to simplify the Hindi of news broadcasts. This led many
uncommitted persons to join the ranks of the opponents of Hindi. </span></p>

however remained committed to the transition to Hindi as the official language.
They believed that, though the study of English was to be encouraged, English
could not continue forever as India’s official language. In the interests of
national unity as also economic and political development they also realized
that full transition to Hindi should not be time-bound and should await a
politically more auspicious time when the willing consent of the non-Hindi
areas could be obtained. The non-Hindi leaders became also less and less open
to persuasion and their opposition to Hindi increased with time. One result of
this alienation of non-Hindi language groups was that they too were not open to
rational arguments in favour of Hindi. Instead they veered towards an
indefinite continuance of English. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Sharp differences on the official
language issue surfaced during 1956-60, once again revealing the presence of
disruptive tendencies. In 1956, the Report of the Official Language Commission,
set up in 1955 in terms of a constitutional provision, recommended that Hindi
should start progressively replacing English in various functions of the
central government with effective change taking place in 1965. Its two members
from West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, Professor Suniti Kumar Chatterjee and P.
Subbaroyan, however, dissented, accusing the members of the Commission of
suffering from a pro-Hindi bias, and asked for the continuation of English.
Ironically, Professor Chatterjee was in charge of the Hindi Pracharini Sabha in
Bengal before independence. The Commission’s Report was reviewed by a special
Joint Committee of the Parliament. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

the principal official language but that English would continue as the
associate official language without any restriction being placed on its use.
Hindi would also become an alternative medium for the Union Public Commission
examinations after some time, but for the present it would be introduced in the
examinations as a qualifying subject. In accordance with the President’s
directive, the central government took a series of steps to promote Hindi.
These included the setting up of the Central Hindi Directorate, publication of
standard works in Hindi or in Hindi translation in various fields, compulsory
training of central government employees in Hindi, and translation of major
texts of law into Hindi and promotion of their use by the courts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>All these measures aroused suspicion and
anxiety in the non-Hindi areas and groups. Nor were the Hindi leaders
satisfied. For example, Professor Suniti Kumar Chatterjee, an eminent linguist
and a former staunch advocate and promoter of Hindi, stated in his dissenting
note to the Report of the Official Language Commission that the outlook of the
Commission was one of the ‘Hindi speakers who are to profit immediately and for
a long time to come, if not forever.’ Similarly, in March 1958, C.
Rajagopalachari, ex-President of the Hindi Pracharini Sabha in the South,
declared that ‘Hindi is as much foreign to the non-Hindi speaking people as
English to the protagonists of Hindi.’ On the other hand, two major champions
of Hindi, Purshottam-das Tandon and Seth Govind Das, accused the Joint
Parliamentary Committee of being pro-English. Many of the Hindi leaders also
attacked Nehru and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the Minister of Education, for
dragging their feet in implementing the constitutional provisions and
deliberately delaying the replacement of English. They insisted that the
deadline for the changeover to Hindi laid down in the Constitution must be
rigidly observed. In 1957, Dr Lohia’s Samyukta Socialist Party and the Jan
Sangh launched a militant movement, which continued for nearly two years, for
the immediate replacement of English by Hindi. One of the agitational methods
adopted by the followers of Lohia on a large scale was to deface English
signboards of shops and in other places. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Fully aware of the danger that the
official language issue could pose to Indian polity, the leadership of the
Congress took the grievances of the non-Hindi areas seriously and handled the
issue with great care and caution. The attempt was to work for a compromise.
Nehru time and again made it clear that an official language could not and
would not be imposed on any region of the country and that the pace of
transition to Hindi would have to be determined keeping in view the wishes of
the non-Hindi people. In this he was supported by the leaders of Praja
Socialist Party (PSP) and Communist Party of India (CPI). PSP criticized Hindi
extremism and said that it ‘might severely strain the unity of a multilingual
country like India.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The highlight of Nehru’s approach was a
major statement in the parliament on 7 August 1959. To allay the fears of the
non-Hindi people, he gave a definite assurance: ‘I would have English as an
alternate language as long as the people require it, and I would leave the
decision not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.’
He also told the people of the South that ‘if they do not want to learn Hindi,
let them not learn Hindi.’ He repeated this assurance in the parliament on 4
September 1959. In pursuance of Nehru’s assurances, though with delay caused by
internal party pressures and the India-China war, an Official Languages Act was
passed in 1963. The object of the Act, Nehru declared, was ‘to remove a
restriction which had been placed by the Constitution on the use of English
after a certain date, namely, 1965.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>But this purpose was not fully served as
the assurances were not clearly articulated in the Act. The Act laid down that
‘the English language may … continue to be used in addition to Hindi.’ The
non-Hindi groups criticized the use of the word ‘may’ in place of the word
‘shall’. This made the Act ambiguous in their eyes; they did not regard it as a
statutory guarantee. Many of them wanted a cast iron guarantee not because they
distrusted Nehru but because they were worried about what would happen after
Nehru, especially as the pressure from the Hindi leaders was also growing. The
death of Nehru in June 1964 increased their apprehensions which were further
fuelled by certain hasty steps taken and circulars issued by various ministries
to prepare the ground for the changeover to Hindi in the coming year. For
example, instructions were given that the central government’s correspondence
with the states would be in Hindi, though in case of non-Hindi states an English
translation would be appended. </span></p>

their line of approach to the problem of official language. While previously
they had wanted a slowing down of the replacement of English, now they started
demanding that there should be no deadline fixed for the changeover. Some of
the leaders went much further. The Dravida Munnetra Kazagham and C.
Rajagopalachari, for example, demanded that the Constitution should be amended
and English should be made the official language of India. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>As 26 January 1965 approached, a fear
psychosis gripped the non-Hindi areas, especially Tamil Nadu, creating a strong
anti-Hindi movement. On January, the DMK organized the Madras State Anti-Hindi
Conference which gave a call for observing 26 January as a day of mourning.
Students, concerned for their careers and apprehensive that they would be
outstripped by Hindi-speakers in the all-India services, were the most active
in organizing a widespread agitation and mobilizing public opinion. They raised
and popularized the slogan: ‘Hindi never, English ever.’ They also demanded
amendment of the Constitution. The students’ agitation soon developed into
state-wide unrest. The Congress leadership, though controlling both the state
and the central governments, failed to gauge the depth of the popular feeling
and the widespread character of the movement and instead of negotiating with
the students, made an effort to repress it. Widespread rioting and violence
followed in the early weeks of February leading to large-scale destruction of
railways and other union property. So strong was the anti-Hindi feeling that
several Tamil youth, including four students, burned themselves to death in
protest against the official language policy. Two Tamil ministers, C.
Subramaniam and Alagesan, resigned from the Union Cabinet. The agitation
continued for about two months, taking a toll of over sixty lives through
police firings. The only eminent central leader to show concern for the
agitators was Indira Gandhi, then the Minister for Information and
Broadcasting. At the height of the agitation she flew to Madras, ‘rushed to the
storm-centre of trouble’, showed some sympathy for the agitators and thus
became, after Nehru, the first northern leader to win the trust of the
aggrieved Tamils as well as of the people of the South in general. Efforts were
made by the Jan Sangh and the SSP to organize counter agitation in the Hindi
areas against English, but they did not get much public support. </span></p>

the Union governments and the Congress party to revise their stand. They now
decided to yield to the intense public mood in the South, change their policy
and accept the major demands of the agitators. The Congress Working Committee
announced a series of steps which were to form the basis for a central
enactment embodying concessions and which led to the withdrawal of the Hindi
agitation. This enactment was delayed because of the Indo-Pak war of 1965,
which silenced all dissension in the country. </span></p>

to amend the 1963 Official Language Act on 27 November. The Lok Sabha adopted
the bill, on 16 December 1967, by 205 to 41 votes. The Act gave an unambiguous
legal fortification, to Nehru’s assurances of September 1959. It provided that
the use of English as an associate language in addition to Hindi for the
official work at the Centre and for communication between the Centre and
non-Hindi states would continue as long as the non-Hindi states wanted it,
giving them full veto powers on the question. A virtual indefinite policy of
bilingualism was adopted. The parliament also adopted a policy resolution
laying down that the public service examinations were to be conducted in Hindi
and English and in all the regional languages with the proviso that the
candidates should have additional knowledge of Hindi or English. The states
were to adopt a three-language formula according to which, in the non-Hindi
areas, the mother tongue, Hindi and English or some other national language was
to be taught in schools while in the Hindi areas a non-Hindi language,
preferably a southern language, was to be taught as a compulsory subject. The
Government of India took another important step on the language question in
July 1967. On the basis of the Report of the Education Commission in 1966, it
declared that Indian languages would ultimately become the medium of education
in all subjects at the university level, though the timeframe for the
changeover would be decided by each university to suit its convenience. </span></p>

of debate and several agitations, small and big, and many compromises India had
arrived at a widely-accepted solution of the very difficult problem of the
official and link language for the country. Since 1967, this problem has
gradually disappeared from the political scene, demonstrating the capacity of
the Indian political system to deal with a contentious problem on a democratic
basis, and in a manner that promoted national consolidation. Here was an issue
which emotionally divided the people and which could have jeopardized the unity
of the country, but to which a widely acceptable solution was found through
negotiations and compromise. And it was not only the national leadership
provided by the Congress, with some hiccups on the way, which came up to the
mark; the opposition parties too measured up when it came to the crunch. In the
end, the DMK, in whose rise to power the language issue played an important
role, also helped by cooling down the political temper in Tamil Nadu. </span></p>

for all times to come. Problem solving in a nation as complex as India is bound
to be a continuous process. But it is significant that Hindi has been making
rapid progress in non-Hindi areas through education, trade, tourism, films,
radio and television. The use of Hindi as an official language has also been
growing though English is still dominant. Simultaneously, English, as a second
language has been spreading fast, including in the Hindi-speaking areas. A
witness of this is the number of private English-medium schools, however poor

manifold. Both English and Hindi are likely to grow as link languages just as
regional languages are more and more occupying the official, educational and
media space. The proof of the growth of Hindi, English and regional languages
lies in the rapid growth of newspapers in all of them. In fact, English is not
only likely to survive in India for all times to come, but it remains and is
likely to grow as a language of communication between the intelligentsia all
over the country, as a library language, and as the second language of the
universities. Hindi, on the other hand, has so far failed to perform any of the
three roles. Of course, the ideal of making Hindi the link language of the
country remains. But the way the enthusiastic protagonists of Hindi promoted
Hindi’s cause, they pushed back the chances of this happening for a long time
to come. </span></p>

states during prior to independence-</span></span><span lang=EN>Demand of states
on linguistic basis was developed even before independence of India under
British rule. Lokmanya Tilak was perhaps the first national leader to
appreciate the diversity of languages and urge the Congress to commence working
in vernacular languages; he also advocated reorganisation of the provinces on a
linguistic basis. As early as in 1891, he wrote in Kesari, “The present
administrative division of India is the result of a certain historical process
and in some cases purely result of accident… if they are replaced by units
formed on a linguistic basis, each of them will have some measure of
homogeneity and will provide encouragement to the people and languages of the
respective regions.” The decision of the All India Congress Committee of the
Indian National Congress on 8th April 1917 to constitute a separate Congress
Province (Andhra Provincial Congress Committee) from out of the Telugu speaking
districts of the Madras Presidency strengthened the argument for the linguistic
re-organization of British India provinces. Already a consensus was evolving in
British India among several Indian leaders that, for the effective
administration, the language of governance and education should be the dominant
language of the people, and that provinces, for this purpose, should be
re-organized on linguistic lines. But Gandhi thought otherwise, when the
proposal to re-organize the provincial committees on linguistic lines came up
before the AICC in 1917. Gandhi thought that the question might wait the
implementing of Reforms [initiated by the British] but Lokamanya Tilak saw the
point, namely, that Linguistic Provinces were an essential condition
prerequisite to real Provincial autonomy. The first generation of freedom
fighters realised the importance of linguistic states at the time of the
partition of Bengal in 1905. European capitalism had had good experience of the
democratic effects of language based administrative units. British colonial
rule skillfully crafted multilingual administrative territories in India. In
pursuit of this policy, H S Risley, the then home secretary, submitted a note
to the Crown in December 1903, suggesting the division of Bengal, and then Lord
Curzon did divide Bengal, a linguistically homogenous unit, into two
religiously heterogeneous units, in order to stem the freedom movement. But
this colonial administrative action helped the Bengali speaking people to learn
to think in terms of linguis-29</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>tic unity. The movement for reunification
of Bengal also gave an impetus to a movement to reorganise the provinces on the
basis of language in the eastern region of India. Reflecting this popular
sentiment, at its Calcutta session in 1905, Indian National Congress opposed
Curzon’s decision. Its resolution stated, “This congress recommends the adoption
of some arrangement which would be consistent with administrative efficiency
and would place the entire Bengali speaking community under an undivided
administration.” </span></p>

forced to undo the bifurcation of Bengal on religious basis, but at the same
time it carved out Assam and Bihar as separate provinces in 1911 on a
linguistic basis. However, the acceptance of federalism by the Lucknow session
of the Indian National Congress in 1916 inspired the demands for several such states.
On April 8, 1917, on the basis of its Lucknow session’s recommendation, the
AICC demanded a Telugu-speaking state carved out of the Madras Presidency. The
Home Rule movement also emphasised the need for creation of linguistic
provinces. In fact, this movement served as an important milestone in the
reorganisation of linguistically homogenous areas. In her presidential address
in the Calcutta Congress session in 1917, Annie Besant said, “Sooner or later,
preferably sooner, provinces will have to be re-delimited on a linguistic
basis.” Why Annie Besant favoured language based provinces? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Annie Besant’s Home Rule movement
attracted mostly the South Indians, whose participation was perhaps responsible
for the early acceptance of the legitimacy of linguistic identities. Also Mrs.
Besant shot in to prominence in the wake of the agitation against the partition
of Bengal, an agitation, which should be considered the precursor to subsequent
linguistic movements in the country. Subsequently, in its 1920 Nagpur session,
the Congress accepted in principle the creation of linguistic states. With this
spirit, first the Congress took initiatives to organise their provincial
committees on linguistic basis. The process that started with the formation of
a separate Linguistic Circle of the Indian National Congress for the
Telugu-speaking territory became a basic principle for the recognition of the
linguistic identity of various populations to carve out the administrative
units in India. Language was yet to receive a more serious and detailed
scru-tiny in relation to the demands for Self-Government. The role of the
Indian vernacular for mass-based agitations and for mass communication was very
well recognized even in the earliest part of the history of the Indian National
Congress, but the demand for its role in administration and education began to
be debated with great strength only in the 1920s within the Indian National
Congress with the emergence of Gandhi as its supreme leader. In 1927, the
Congress again declared that it was committed to “the redistribution of
provinces on a linguistic basis”, and reaffirmed its stance several times,
including in the election manifesto of 1945-46. The emerging idea of federalism
forced the colonial administration in India to appoint a commission on
linguistic reorganisation of provinces, headed by Sir John Simon, in 1927.
Though diverse claims were put forward before the commission for redistribution
of the provincial territories on linguistic basis, the commission observed,
“…in no case the linguistic or racial principle can be accepted as the sole
test.” It was in response to Simon Commission’s observation that the Nehru
Committee submitted its own report in 1928. Consisting of Sir Tej Bahadur
Sapru, Sir Ali Imam, Subhash Chandra Bose etc and presided over by Motilal
Nehru, this committee represented various trends in the freedom movement, and
its report for the first time formally incorporated the demand for linguistic
reorganisation of the provinces. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

justification of the demand, “Partly geographical and partly economic and

Political movements for the creation of new, linguistic-based states developed.
The Congress-led Government became concerned that the states formed solely on a
linguistic basis might be unsuitable, and might even pose a risk to the national
unity. This fear was generated mainly due to division of India. In the
interregnum, movements for Ayikya Kerala, Samyukta Maharashtra and Vishalandhra
picked up momentum. The Communist Part of India took the lead in forging these
movements and popularising the concept of linguistic states in India and its
efficacy in democratisation of independent India. A separate linguistic state
of Andhra turned out to be a hot issue. In the Constituent Assembly itself, the
government of India made a statement that Andhra could be mentioned as a
separate unit in the new constitution, thus prompting the drafting committee to
constitute a separate committee to inquire into the demands of linguistic
states. It was thus that the Dhar commission came into existence with a mandate
to examine and report on the formation of new provinces of Andhra, Karnataka,
Kerala, and Maharashtra. </span></p>

Commission (or Dar Commission):</span></span><span lang=EN> On 17 June 1948,
Rajendra Prasad, the President of the Constituent Assembly, set up the
Linguistic Provinces Commission to recommend whether the states should be
reorganized on linguistic basis or not. The committee included SK Dar (retired
Judge of the Allahabad High Court), JN Lal (lawyer) and Panna Lal (retired
Indian Civil Service officer). In its 10 December 1948 report, the Commission
recommended that “the formation of provinces on exclusively or even mainly linguistic
considerations is not in the larger interests of the Indian nation“. The
commission went on to say, “bilingual districts in border areas, which have
developed an economic and organic life of their own, should not be broken up
and should be disposed of on considerations of their own special needs.” The
commission asked the government of India to reorganise the states on the basis
of geographical continuity, financial self-sufficiency, administrative
convenience and capacity for future development. </span></p>

Patel, in addition to the Congress president Pattabhi Sitaramayya. The
committee shifted the emphasis from language as the basis to security, unity
and economic prosperity, thus back-tracking on the party’s own election
manifesto. This was perhaps influenced by the situation prevailing immediately
after the partition. The three-member committee felt that, in Patel’s words,
supporting “such federal demands will come in the way of growth of India as a
nation.” In its report dated 1 April 1949, the Committee stated that the time
was not suitable for formation of new provinces, but also stated “if public
sentiment is insistent and overwhelming, we, as democrats, have to submit to
it, but subject to certain limitations in regard to the good of India as a
whole.” </span></p>

Malayalam-speaking State was a recent and artificial one and backed only by
parties seeking ‘conquest of power’. Krishna Menon alleged that the anticipated

creation of separate Kerala and Tamil States was inspired by the personal views
of one of the members of the Commission (the reference being to <span

inadvisable for economic, political, administrative, strategic and national
security reasons. As a sectarian sub-nationalism of fascist orientation was
developing in the Tamil country, he argued, a separate Tamil province would be
very anti-national, while the Kerala State would doubtless go Communist after
the next general elections with disastrous domestic and international
consequences. </span></p>

state of Vishalandhra, consisting of all Telugu speaking people scattered
across three regions, was one of the slogans of Andhra Mahasabha. As the

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Telangana struggle of 1946-51 brought
the key issues of land reforms and linguistic states back on the agenda and the
central government had to finally take note of these issues. The whole
development proved very costly for the Congress. In the first general elections
held in 1952, the Telugu people elected with thumping majorities those who had
fought for Vishalandhra. In the Madras legislative assembly, the Congress could
get a mere 43 out of the 140 seats falling in the Andhra region. Though with
some difficulties, the Congress foisted upon the province Rajagopalachari as
the chief minister, and thus was scuttled the chances for the formation of a
non-Congress government in undivided Madras, which would have been the first
non-Congress government in independent India. Backed by the tremendous support
from Telugu people for Vishalandhra, on July 16, 1952, P Sundarayya moved a
private member’s bill in parliament seeking the formation of a linguistic
Andhra state. In this speech, Sundarayya said, “Rather than with this kind of
multilingual states, the country will be more united once the linguistic
reorganisation of states is done… If these demands are not met, the situation
will be more volatile.” Sundarayya also tried to assuage Nehru’s fears about
security and integrity of the newly independent India by saying, “The
linguistic states, instead of being a threat to the integrity of the country,
can support and consolidate national security and integrity in a much more
effective way.” But Nehru and the Congress were not convinced and Nehru refused
to concede the demand. On the other hand, dissatisfied with Congress inaction
on the demand, <span class=0Text>Potti Sri</span> <span class=0Text>Ramulu</span>,
a prominent Congress leader from Andhra region, died after 58 days of fast. Sri
Ramulu’s death engulfed the entire Andhra in a chaos. The spontaneous protests
were so widespread and intense that the central government was forced to give
in to the demand and for this purpose brought a bill in parliament on September
2, 1953. The government at that time took enough caution not to use the word
“linguistic state.” Speaking in Rajya Sabha on this occasion, Sundarayya
criticised the Nehru government severely. He said, “Even after 30 years of
experience, the government is trying to negate the principle of linguistic
states by merely refuting it. People will succeed in getting the linguistic
states formed.” Subsequently, in 1953, the 16 northern, Telugu-speaking
districts of Madras State became the new State of Andhra. This sparked of
agitations all over the country, with linguistic groups demanding separate
statehoods. Finally, Nehru had to come to terms with the popular sentiments and
announce on the floor of Lok Sabha the formation of Andhra Rashtram with
undisputed 14 districts. Thus on October 1, 1953, the new state of Andhra
Rashtram came into being through bifurcation of Madras province. (But still
Hyderabad regions of Telugu speaking areas, what we call Telangana, were not
included). Creation of Andhra Rashtram strengthened the struggle for Vishalandhra
(which would contain all Telugu speaking areas) and also for United Kerala and
Samyukta Maharashtra. Yielding to pressures and mass mobilisation, the Nehru
government set up a States Reorganisation Commission (SRC), also known as Fazal
Ali commission. </span></p>

necessary in the interest of our national unity.“ The States Reorganisation
Act, 1956: The States Reorganisation Act, 1956 was a major reform of the
boundaries of India’s states and territories, organising them along linguistic
lines. Although additional changes to India’s state boundaries have been made
since 1956, the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 remains the single most
extensive change in state boundaries since the independence of India in 1947.
The Act came into effect at the same time as the Constitution (Seventh

constitutional framework for India’s existing states and the requirements to

recommendation but it was not accepted in the Act. The Commission’s report
judged the arguments for and against the merger of the Telugu majority
Telangana region (of Hyderabad State) and the Andhra State (created in 1953).
It was recommended that it will be in the interests of Andhra as well as
Telangana, if for the present, the Telangana area is to constitute into a
separate State, which may be known as the Hyderabad State with provision for
its unification with Andhra after the general elections likely to be held in or
about 1961 if by a two thirds majority the legislature of the residency
Hyderabad State expresses itself in favor of such unification”. Hyderabad Chief
Minister in his letter to Congress President said Communist parties supported
the merger for their political calculations. Hyderabad PCC chief said
overwhelming majority from Congress party opposed the merger. In Hyderabad
assembly more than two-third MLA’s supported the merger and opposed the Fazal
Ali Commission’s recommendation to keep Telangana as a separate State for 5
years. An agreement was reached between Telangana leaders and Andhra leaders on
20 February 1956 to merge Telangana and Andhra with promises to safeguard
Telangana’s interests. The Gentlemen’s agreement of Andhra Pradesh was signed
between Telangana and Andhra leaders before the formation of the state of
Andhra Pradesh in 1956. The agreement provided safeguards with the purpose of
preventing discrimination against Telangana by the government of Andhra
Pradesh. Following the Gentlemen’s agreement, the central government
established a unified Andhra Pradesh on November 1, 1956. There have been
several movements to invalidate the merger of Telangana and Andhra, major ones
occurring in 1969, 1972 and 2000s onwards. The Telangana movement gained
momentum over decades becoming a widespread political demand of creating a new
state from the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh. In early 2014, the Andhra
Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 was approved by the Indian parliament, and
Telangana became India’s 29th state on 2 June 2014. The violations of this agreement
are cited as one of the reasons for formation of separate statehood for
Telangana. </span></span></p>

the linguistic basis of the demand, while downplaying its religious basis — a
state where the distinct Sikh identity could be preserved. The Hindu newspapers
from Jalandhar, exhorted the Punjabi Hindus to declare Hindi as their “mother
tongue”, so that the Punjabi Subah proponents could be deprived of the argument
that their demand was solely linguistic. The States Reorganization Commission
rejected the demand for a Punjabi-majority state saying that it lacked a
majority support and that Punjabi was not grammatically very distinct from
Hindi. , Though the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) was merged
with Punjab. Akali Dal continued its movement, and in 1966 the Punjab

(1975) was enacted to make Sikkim a full-fledged state of the Indian Union (the
22nd state). This amendment amended the First and the Fourth Schedules to the
Constitution and added a new Article 371-F to provide for certain special
provisions with respect to the administration of Sikkim. It also repealed
Article 2A and the Tenth Schedule that were added by the 35th Amendment Act of
1974. </span></span></p>

important aspect of the language problem has been the status of minority
languages. Unilingual states were not possible in whatever manner their
boundaries were drawn. Consequently, a large number of linguistic minorities,
that is, those who speak a language other than the main or the official
language of the state, continue to exist in linguistically reorganized states.
Overall nearly 18 per cent of India’s population do not speak the official
language of the states where they live as their mother tongue. There is of
course a great deal of variation among the states on this count. According to
the 1971 census, the percentages of linguistic minorities to total population ranged
from 4 in Kerala to 34 in Karnataka, 3.9 in Assam to 44.5 in Jammu and Kashmir.

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>From
the beginning, the important point to be decided upon was the status and rights
of these minorities in their states. On the one hand, there was the question of
their protection, for there was the ever-present danger of them being meted out
unfair treatment, on the other, there was the need to promote their integration
with the major language group of a state. A linguistic minority had to be given
the confidence that it would not be discriminated against by the majority and
that its language and culture would continue to exist and develop. At the same
time, the majority had to be assured that meeting the needs of the linguistic
minority would not generate separatist sentiments or demands and that the
minorities would develop a degree of state loyalty. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>To
confront this problem certain fundamental rights were provided to the
linguistic minorities in the Constitution. For example, Article 30 states that
‘all minorities, whether based an religion or language, shall have the right to
establish and administer educational institutions of their choice’ and, more
important, </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>‘that
the state shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions discriminate
against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the
management of a minority, whether based on religion or language.’ Article 347
lays down that on a demand being made on behalf of a minority, the President
may direct that its language shall be officially recognized throughout the
state or any part thereof for such purposes as he might specify. The official
policy since 1956, sanctioned by a constitutional amendment in that year, has
been to provide for instruction in the mother tongue in the primary and secondary
classes wherever there are sufficient number of children to form a class. The
amendment also provides for the appointment of a Commissioner for Linguistic
Minorities to investigate and report regularly on the implementation of these
safeguards. On the whole, the central government has tended to play a very
positive role in defence of the rights of the minorities, but the
implementation of the minority safeguards is within the purview of the state
governments and therefore differs from state to state. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>In
general, despite some progress in several states, in most of them the position
of the linguistic minorities has not been satisfactory. The constitutional
safeguards have quite often been inadequately enforced. The Commissioner for
Linguistic Minorities has in his reports regularly noted innumerable cases of
discrimination against linguistic minorities in matters of schooling, admission
to technical and medical institutions and employment in the state public
services because of lack of proficiency in the official language of the state.
However, a redeeming feature is that quite often facilities for primary
education in the mother tongue of the minorities have been provided, though
these maybe inadequate in terms of competent teachers and textbooks. But even
here the big exception is the all-round failure in the case of tribal minority
languages. </span></span></p>

nearly all the major languages of India were also the official languages of one
state or the other, Urdu was not the official language of any state except the
small state of Jammu and Kashmir where the mother tongues were in any case

any part of the country. On the contrary, it faced official discrimination and
hostility both in U.P. and Bihar. </span></span></p>

may briefly take up the case of U.P., though the position was no different in
Bihar. The U.P. government decided early on to declare Hindi as the only official
language of the state; the subterfuge was that Hindi and Urdu were not two
separate languages and therefore there was no need to make Urdu a second
official language! In practice, Urdu began to be abolished in many primary
schools. Its use as a medium of instruction was also increasingly limited. For
example, in 1979-80, only 3.69 per cent of primary school students received
instruction in Urdu while the number of Urdu speakers in 1981 was 10.5 per
cent. The Hindi protagonists also began to eliminate Urdu words from written
Hindi. The neglect of Urdu in the state led the well-known, left-wing Urdu
critic, S. Ehtesham Husain, to complain: ‘Urdu is being constantly termed as
only an off-shoot or variety of Hindi, a foreign language, a language of the Muslims,
an instrument of communal hatred and an enemy of Indian unity. All these
contrary things are said in the same breath, to suppress it.’</span></span></p>

speakers, therefore, were persistent in demanding that Urdu should be
recognized as the second official language in the states where it had a large
presence, especially in U.P. and Bihar. The U.P. government was equally
consistent and successful in opposing the demand; its main justification being
that the States Reorganization Commission had recommended that at least 30 per
cent population in a state should speak a language before it could be made the
second official or regional language. Jawaharlal Nehru, in particular, was very
supportive of Urdu and critical of the anti-Urdu thinking and activities of a
large number of per-37</span></span></p>

literatures and cultures. It is cent per cent an Indian language.’ </span></span></p>

pointed out that Urdu had ‘enriched Indian culture and thought.’ He asked the
chief minister of U.P. to declare Urdu as a second official language in
districts where it was widely used and in other areas to give it the full
facilities of a minority language. But even when Nehru succeeded in persuading
the U.P. government to agree to take certain steps in this regard, they were
nullified by laxity in their implementation. The U.P. </span></span></p>

refused to pass legislation giving legal sanctity to the rights granted to Urdu
on the ground that such a step might lead to communal riots. The governments of
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were more supportive of Urdu. In Andhra, Urdu has
been recognized since 1968 as an additional language for the Telengana region.
And in both the states, adequate facilities are provided for instruction
through the medium of Urdu in the primary stage and for instruction in Urdu at
the higher school stages. Two other aspects of Urdu’s position may be noted.
First, unfortunately the question of Urdu has got entangled with the communal
question. While many Muslims regard it as the language of their community as
such, many Hindu communalists are hostile to it because of their anti-Muslim
ideological position. Second, despite active hostility of many and official
neglect, Urdu continues not only to exist but even grow in terms of literary
output, journals and newspapers and especially as the language of films and
television because of its inherent vigour and cultural roots among the Indian
people. </span></span></p>

task of integrating the tribal people into the mainstream was extremely
complex, given the varied conditions under which they live in different parts
of the country, and their different languages and distinct cultures. The 1971
census recorded over 400 tribal communities numbering nearly 38 million people
and constituting nearly 6.9 per cent of the Indian population. Spread all over
India, their greatest concentration is in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa,
north-eastern India, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. </span></span></p>

in the North-East, they constitute minorities in their home states. Residing

isolation, and their traditions, habits, cultures and ways of life were
markedly different from those of their non-tribal neighbours. Nevertheless,
except in the North-East, the two had for centuries interacted culturally,
socially, economically and politically. </span></span></p>

most parts of the country, colonialism brought radical transformation of the
tribals as their relative isolation was eroded by the penetration of market
forces and they were integrated with the British and princely administrations.
A large number of money-lenders, traders, revenue farmers and other middlemen
and petty officials invaded the tribal areas and disrupted the tribals’
traditional way of life. They were increasingly engulfed in debt and lost their
lands to outsiders, often being reduced to the position of agricultural
labourers, sharecroppers and rack-rented tenants. Many were forced to retreat
further into the hills. Belated legislation to prevent alienation of land by
the tribal people failed to halt the process. Verrier Elwin, who lived nearly
all his life among the tribal people in central and north-eastern India and who
was one of the formative influences in the evolution of the new government’s
policies towards the tribes, was to refer to the fate of the tribal people
under British rule as follows: ‘But now they suffered oppression and exploitation,
for there soon came merchants and liquor-venders, cajoling, tricking, swindling
them in their ignorance and simplicity until bit by bit their broad acres
dwindled and they sank into the poverty in which many of them still live
today.’</span></span></p>

‘missionaries were destroying their art, their dances, their weaving and their
whole culture.’ Colonialism also transformed the tribals’ relationship with the
forest. They depended on the forest for food, fuel and cattle feed and raw
materials for their handicrafts. In many parts of India the hunger for land by
the immigrant peasants from the plains led to the destruction of forests,
depriving the tribals of their traditional means of livelihood. To conserve
forests and to facilitate their commercial exploitation, the colonial
authorities brought large tracts of forest lands under forest laws which
forbade shifting cultivation and put severe restrictions on the tribals’ use of
the forest and their access to forest products. Loss of land, indebtedness,
exploitation by middlemen, denial of access to forests and forest products, and
oppression and extortion by policemen, forest officials, and other government
officials was to lead to a series of tribal uprisings in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries—for example the Santhal uprising and the Munda rebellion
led by Birsa Munda—and to the participation of the tribal people in the
national and peasant movements in Orissa, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra,
Maharashtra and Gujarat. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>The
preservation of the tribal people’s rich social and cultural heritage lay at
the heart of the government’s policy of tribal integration. As Jawaharlal
Nehru, the main influence in shaping the government’s attitude towards the
tribals put it: ‘The first problem we have to face there (in the tribal areas)
is to inspire them (the tribal people) with confidence and to make them feel at
one with India, and to realize that they are part of India and have an honoured
place in it.’ At the same time, ‘India to them should signify not only a
protecting force but a liberating one.’ Indian nationalism, Nehru thought, was
capable of accommodating the uniqueness of the tribal people. There were two
major approaches regarding the place to be accorded to tribals in Indian
society. One approach was to leave the tribal people alone, uncontaminated by
modern influences operating outside their world and to let them stay more or
less as they were. The second approach was that of assimilating them completely
and as quickly as possible into the Indian society all around them. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>The
disappearance of the tribal way of life was not to be regretted; it was to be welcomed
for that would represent their ‘upliftment.’</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>Jawaharlal
Nehru rejected both these approaches. The first approach, of treating the
tribal people ‘as muse-um specimens to be observed and written about,’ was, he
said, ‘to insult them.’ The tribal people, he wrote, </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>‘could
not be left cut off from the world as they were.’ Isolation was in any case
impossible at this stage, for the process of penetration by the outside world
had already gone too far and ‘it was not possible or desirable to isolate them.’
The second approach of allowing them ‘to be engulfed by the masses of Indian
humanity,’ or of their assimilation through the operation of normal outside
forces was also wrong, according to Nehru. This would lead to the loss of the
tribals’ social and cultural identity and of the many virtues they possessed.
In fact, he pointed out, ‘if normal factors were allowed to operate,
unscrupulous people from outside would take possession of tribal lands … and
forests and interfere with the life of the tribal people.’ </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>This
would also ‘upset their whole life and culture, which had so much of good in
them.’ Instead of these two approaches, Nehru favoured the policy of
integrating the tribal people in Indian society, of making them an integral
part of the Indian nation, even while maintaining their distinct identity and
culture. There were two basic parameters of the Nehruvian approach: ‘the tribal
areas have to progress’ and ‘they have to progress in their own way’. Progress
did not mean ‘an attempt merely to duplicate what we have got in other parts of
India.’ Whatever was good in the rest of India would ‘be adopted by them
gradually.’ Moreover, whatever changes were needed would be ‘worked out by the
tribals themselves.’</span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>The
problem was how to combine these two seemingly contradictory approaches. Nehru
stood for economic and social development of the tribal people in multifarious
ways, especially in the fields of communication, modern medical facilities,
agriculture and education. In this regard, he laid down certain broad
guidelines for government policy. First, the tribals should develop along the
lines of their own genius; there should be no imposition or compulsion from
outside. The non-tribals should not approach them with a superiority complex.
Rather, the understanding should be that they had an equal contribution to make
to the evolution of the common culture and social and political life of the
country. Second, tribal rights in land and forests should be respected and no
outsider should be able to take possession of tribal lands. The incursion of
the market economy into tribal areas had to be strictly controlled and
regulated. Third, it was necessary to encourage the tribal languages which
‘must be given all possible support and the conditions in which they can
flourish must be safeguarded.’</span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>Fourth,
for administration, reliance should be placed on the tribal people themselves,
and administrators should be recruited from amongst them and trained. As few as
possible outsiders should be introduced as administrators in tribal areas and
they should be carefully chosen. They should have a sympathetic and
understanding approach, and should not consider themselves superior to or apart
from the tribal people. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>They
should be prepared to share their life with the tribal people among whom they
work. Fifth, there should be no over-administration of tribal areas. The effort
should be to administer and develop them through the tribals own social and
cultural institutions. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>Nehru’s
approach was in turn based on the nationalist policy towards tribals since the
twenties when Gandhiji set up ashrams in the tribal areas and promoted
constructive work. After independence this policy was supported by Rajendra
Prasad, the first President of India, and other major political leaders. To give
shape to the government’s policy, a beginning was made in the Constitution
itself which directed under Article 46 </span></span></p>

the state should promote with special care the educational and economic
interests of the tribal people and should protect them from social injustice
and all forms of exploitation, through special legislation. The governors of
the states in which tribal areas were situated were given special
responsibility to protect tribal interests, including the power to modify
central and state laws in their application to tribal areas, and to frame
regulations for the protection of tribals’ right to land and also their
protection from moneylenders. </span></span></p>

application of the fundamental rights was amended for this purpose. The

Constitution also provided for the setting up of Tribal Advisory Councils in

appointed by the President to investigate whether the safeguards provided for

as well as executive action was taken by the state governments to prevent loss
of tribal lands to non-tribal people and to prevent exploitation of the tribals
by moneylenders. The central and the state governments created special
facilities and organized special programmes for the welfare and development of
the tribal areas and the tribal people including the promotion of cottage and
village industries and generation of employment among them. Large expenditures
were undertaken and large sums set apart in the Plans for the purpose. The
funding for tribal welfare significantly increased after 1971. In spite of the
constitutional safeguards and the efforts of the central and state governments,
the tribals’ progress and welfare has been very slow, and even dismal. Except
in the North-East, the tribals continue to be poor, indebted, landless and
often unemployed. The problem often lies in weak execution of even
well-intentioned measures. Quite often there is a divergence between the
central and the state government policies, the latter being less in tune with
tribal interests. In particular, state governments have been relatively
ineffective in administering the positive policies and laws laid down by the
central government or by the state governments themselves, as repeatedly shown
by the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and in the
reports of the Planning Commission. Quite often the funds allocated for tribal
welfare are not spent or are spent without corresponding results, or are even
misappropriated. One of the watchdogs of tribal interests, the Tribal Advisory
Councils, have not functioned effectively. </span></span></p>

the administrative personnel are ill-trained or even prejudiced against
tribals. But sympathetic officials are also known to be quickly transferred out
of tribal areas under the pressure of traders, moneylenders, forest contractors
and land-grabbers. A major handicap from which tribals suffer is denial of
justice, often because of their unfamiliarity with the laws and the legal
system. Laws preventing transfer of land to outsiders have continued to be
evaded, leading to alienation of land and eviction of tribal. Rapid extension
of mines and industries has worsened their conditions in many areas. While
deforestation proceeds apace through the cooperation of corrupt officials and
politicians with forest contractors, the tribals’ traditional right of access
to the forest and its produce is continuously curtailed. Forest laws and
regulations are also used by unsympathetic and often corrupt forest officials
to harass and exploit the tribal people. As a result of loss of land,
deforestation and restrictions on the access to the forest, the tribal people
have been facing growing unemployment and have been increasingly driven into more
inaccessible stretches of hills and jungles. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>The
progress of education among the tribal people has been disappointingly slow. In
many areas, primary education through the tribal languages has taken place, but
in others the state governments have tended to neglect tribal languages and
education through their medium. Tribal society almost everywhere has also been
gradually developing class differences and a class structure with those
belonging to the upper crust often joining forces with the upper crust of the
outsiders. Further, the major gains of whatever development takes place in the
fields of education, employment in administration, economy and political
patronage are reaped by the small segment of the tribal elites which has slowly
emerged and grown. On the whole, though there are a few danger signals, certain
positive developments in the tribal sphere have occurred since 1947.
Legislation to protect tribal rights and interests, activities of the tribal
welfare departments, Panchayati Raj, spread of literacy and education,
reservations in government services and in higher educational institutions, and
repeated elections have led to increasing confidence among the tribal people
and greater political participation by them—or at least by the growing middle
classes and intelligentsia among them—in the constitutional political
processes. They are now insisting on a greater and more active political role
for themselves, and acquiring increasing representation in different political
structures and institutions. Above all, they are demanding a greater share in
national economic development. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>Protest
movements have sprung up among tribals out of their frustration with the lack
of development and welfare. These are bound in time to produce positive results.
The government policy has usually been conciliatory, through not necessarily
successful in redressing tribal grievances. But some of the protest movements
have taken to violence, leading to strong state action against them. Little
ground has been gained by them, though they have often dramatically drawn
national attention to the tribal condition. The growing tribal antagonism
towards the non-tribal people or outsiders living in tribal areas has been
another unfortunate development. Undoubtedly, some of the outsiders like
traders, moneylenders, landlords and government officials have been a scourge
of the tribal areas, but, over decades, many other outsiders—</span></span></p>

workers, teachers, doctors and other middle and lower middle class persons—have
now settled there, outnumbering the tribals in almost all tribal areas outside
the North-East. The mass of the tribals and non-tribals are equally poor and
have a common interest in economic and social development as also social and
economic justice. Besides, most of the middleclass non-tribals, including many
of the traders and industrialists, do perform useful economic functions in the
tribal areas. Any undue antagonism and antipathy between the tribals and
non-tribals would be inimical and even dangerous to both. It is no longer true
that the only relationship that can exist between the two is an exploitative
one. Tribals cannot expect to revert to isolation from their non-tribal
neighbours or to prevent massive interaction with them, including their in-migration.
In fact, the two can protect and promote their interests only through mutual
cooperation. </span></span></p>

tribes of north-eastern India, consisting of over hundred groups, speaking a
wide variety of languages and living in the hill tracts of Assam, shared many
of the features and problems of the tribal people in the rest of the country.
But their situation was different in several respects. For one, they
constituted the overwhelming majority of the population in most of the areas they
inhabited. Then, non-tribals had not penetrated these areas to any significant
extent, though economic contacts between the tribal and the nontribal areas had
been developing over time. This was because of the British policy in the late
nineteenth century. </span></span></p>

tribal areas occupied by the British then formed part of the Assam province but
were given a separate administrative status. Their socio-political structure

plains was followed. In particular, no non-tribal plainsmen were allowed to
acquire land in the tribal areas because of which the tribals suffered little
loss of land. </span></span></p>

the same time, the British government permitted and even encouraged the
Christian missionaries to move in and establish schools, hospitals and churches
and to proselytise, thus introducing change and modern ideas among some of the
tribal youth. The missionaries, in turn, collaborated with the colonial
authorities and helped keep the nationalist influence out of the tribal areas,
besides encouraging their isolation from the rest of the population of Assam
and India. Infact, immediately after independence, some of the missionaries and
other foreigners even promoted sentiment in favour of separate and independent

virtual absence of any political or cultural contact of the tribals in the
North-East with the political life of the rest of India was also a striking
difference. As we have seen in an earlier chapter, a powerful factor in the
unification of the Indian people as a nation was the common bonds forged in the
course of the anti-imperialist struggle. But this struggle had little impact
among the tribals of the North-East. To quote Jawaharlal Nehru: ‘The essence of
our struggle for freedom was the unleashing of a liberating force in India.
This force did not even affect the frontier people in one of the most important
tribal areas.’ And again: ‘Thus they never experienced a sensation of being in
a country called India and they were hardly influenced by the struggle for
freedom or other movements in India. Their chief experience of outsiders was
that of British officers and Christian missionaries who generally tried to make
them anti-Indian.’</span></span></p>

reflection of this policy was in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution which
applied only to the tribal areas of Assam. The Sixth Schedule offered a fair
degree of self-government to the tribal people by providing for autonomous
districts and the creation of district and regional councils which would
exercise some of the legislative and judicial functions within the overall
jurisdiction of the Assam legislature and the parliament. </span></span></p>

objective of the Sixth Schedule was to enable tribals to live according to

further amend the constitutional provisions relating to the tribal people if it
was found necessary to do so with a view to promote further autonomy. But this

and Verrier Elwin’s policies were implemented best of all in the North-East
Frontier Agency or NEFA, which was created in 1948 out of the border areas of
Assam. NEFA was established as a Union Territory outside the jurisdiction of
Assam and placed under a special administration. From the beginning, the
administration was manned by a special cadre of officers who were asked to
implement specially designed developmental policies without disturbing the
social and cultural pattern of the life of the people. As a British
anthropologist who spent nearly all his life studying the tribal people and

measure of isolation combined with a sympathetic and imaginative policy of a
progressive administration has here created a situation unparalleled in other
parts of India.’ NEFA was named Arunachal Pradesh and granted the status of a
separate state in 1987. While NEFA was developing comfortably and in harmony with
the rest of the country, problems developed in the other tribal areas which
were part of Assam administratively. The problems arose because the hill tribes
of Assam had no cultural affinity with the Assamese and Bengali residents of
the plains. The tribals were afraid of losing their identities and being
assimilated by what was, with some justification, seen to be a policy of
Assimilation. Especially distasteful to them was the attitude of superiority
and even contempt often adopted by non-tribals working among them as teachers,
doctors, government officials, traders, etc. There was also a feeling among
them that the Assamese government failed to understand them and tended to
neglect their interests. This feeling represented not so much the reality as
the failure of the political leadership of Assam to redress tribal grievances
in time and with deep concern. Soon, resentment against the Assam government
began to mount and a demand for a separate hill state arose among some sections
of the tribal people in the mid-fifties. But this demand was not pressed with
vigour; nor did the Government of India encourage it, for it felt that the
future of the hill tribes was intimately connected with Assam though further

the demand gained greater strength when the Assamese leaders moved in 1960
towards making Assamese the sole official language of the state. In 1960,
various political parties of the hill areas merged into the All Party Hill
Leaders Conference (APHLC) and again demanded a separate state within the
Indian union. The passage of the Assam Official Language Act, making Assamese
the official language of the state, and thus the refusal of the demand for the
use of the tribal languages in administration, led to an immediate and strong
reaction in the tribal districts. There were hartals and demonstrations, and a
major agitation developed. In the 1962 elections, the overwhelming majority of
the Assembly seats from the tribal areas were won by the advocates of a separate
state, who decided to boycott the State Assembly. Prolonged discussions and
negotiations followed. Several commissions and committees examined the issue.
Finally, in 1969, through a constitutional amendment, Meghalaya was carved out
of Assam as ‘a state within a state’ </span></span></p>

had complete autonomy except for law and order which remained a function of the

North-East, Meghalaya became a separate state in 1972, incorporating the Garo,
Khasi and Jaintia tribes. Simultaneously, the Union Territories of Manipur and
Tripura were granted statehood. The transition to statehood in the case of
Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh was quite smooth. Trouble
arose in the case of Nagaland and Mizoram where secessionist and
insurrection-ary movements developed. </span></span></p>

the inhabitants of the Naga Hills along the North-East frontier on the Assam-Burma
border. They numbered nearly 500,000 in 1961, constituted less than 0.1 per
cent of India’s population, and consisted of many separate tribes speaking
different languages. The British had isolated the Nagas from the rest of the
country and left them more or less undisturbed though Christian missionary
activity was permitted, and which had led to the growth of a small educated
stratum. Immediately after independence, the Government of India followed a
policy of integrating the Naga areas with the State of Assam and India as a
whole. A section of the Naga leadership, however, opposed such integration and
rose in rebellion under the leadership of A.Z. Phizo, demanding separation from
India and complete independence. They were encouraged in this move by some of
the British officials and missionaries. In 1955, these separatist Nagas
declared the formation of an independent government and the launching of a
violent insurrection. </span></span></p>

Government of India responded with a two-track policy in line with Jawaharlal
Nehru’s wider approach towards the tribal people discussed earlier in this
chapter. On the one hand, the Government of India made it clear that it would
firmly oppose the secessionist demand for the independence of Naga areas and
would not tolerate recourse to violence. Towards a violent secessionist
movement it would firmly follow a policy of suppression and non-negotiations.
As Nehru put it, ‘It does not help in dealing with tough people to have weak
nerves.’ Consequently, when one section of the Nagas organized an armed
struggle for independence, the Government of India replied by sending its army
to Nagaland in early 1956 to restore peace and order. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>On
the other hand, Nehru realized that while strong and quick military action
would make it clear that the rebels were in a no-win situation, total physical
suppression was neither possible nor desirable, for the objective had to be the
conciliation and winning over of the Naga people. Nehru was wedded to a
‘friendly approach’. Even while encouraging the Nagas to integrate with the
rest of the country ‘in mind and spirit’; he favoured their right to maintain
their autonomy in cultural and other matters. He was, therefore, willing to go
a long way to win over the Nagas by granting them a large degree of autonomy.
Refusing to negotiate with Phizo or his supporters as long as they did not give
up their demand for independence or the armed rebellion, he carried on
prolonged negotiations with the more moderate, nonviolent and non-secessionist
Naga leaders, who realized that they could not hope to get a larger degree of
autonomy or a more sympathetic leader to settle with than Nehru. </span></span></p>

fact, once the back of the armed rebellion was broken by the middle of 1957,
the more moderate Naga leaders headed by Dr Imkongliba Ao came to the fore.
They negotiated for the creation of the State of Nagaland within the Indian
union. The Government of India accepted their demand through a series of
intermediate steps; and the State of Nagaland came into existence in 1963. A further
step forward was taken in the integration of the Indian nation. Also, politics
in Nagaland since then followed, for better or worse, the pattern of politics
in the other states of the union. With the formation of Nagaland as a state the
back of rebellion was broken as the rebels lost much of their popular support.
But though the insurgency has been brought under control, sporadic guerilla
activity by Naga rebels trained in China, Pakistan and Burma and periodic
terrorist attacks continue till this day. </span></span></p>

may also refer to one other feature of the Naga situation. Even though the
record of the Indian army in Nagaland has been on the whole clean, especially
if the difficult conditions under which they operate are kept in view, it has
not been without blemish. Its behaviour has been sometimes improper and in rare
cases even brutal. Too many times innocent people have suffered. But then it
has also paid a heavy price through the loss of its soldiers and officers in
guerilla attacks. </span></span></p>

similar to that in Nagaland developed few years later in the autonomous Mizo
district of the North-East. Secessionist demands backed by some British
officials had grown there in 1947 but had failed to get much support from the
youthful Mizo leadership, which concentrated instead on the issues of
democratization of Mizo society, economic development and adequate
representation of Mizos in the Assam legislature. However, unhappiness with the
Assam government’s relief measures during the famine of 1959 and the passage of
the Act in 1961, making Assamese the official language of the state, led to the
formation of the Mizo National Front (MNF), with Laldenga as president. While
participating in electoral politics, the MNF created a military wing which
received arms and ammunition and military training from East Pakistan and
China. On March 1966, the MNF declared independence from India, proclaimed a
military uprising and attacked military and civilian targets. The Government of
India responded with immediate massive counter-insurgency measures by the army.
Within a few weeks the insurrection was crushed and government control
restored, though stray guerilla activity continued. Most of the hard core Mizo
leaders escaped to East Pakistan. </span></span></p>

1973, after the less extremist Mizo leaders had scaled-down their demand to
that of a separate state of Mizoram within the Indian union, the Mizo district
of Assam was separated from Assam and as Mizoram given the status of a Union
Territory. Mizo insurgency gained some renewed strength in the late seventies
but was again effectively dealt with by Indian armed forces. Having decimated
the ranks of the separatist insurgents, the Government of India, continuing to
follow the Nehruvian tribal policy, was now willing to show consideration,
offer liberal terms of amnesty to the remnants of the rebel forces and conduct
negotiations for peace. A settlement was finally arrived at in 1986. Laldenga
and the MNF agreed to abandon underground violent activities, surrender before
the Indian authorities along with their arms, and re-enter the constitutional
political stream. The Government of India agreed to the grant of full statehood
to Mizoram, guaranteeing full autonomy in regard to culture, tradition, and
land laws, etc. As a part of the accord, a government with Laldenga as chief
minister was formed in the new State of Mizoram in February 1987. </span></span></p>

tribal area of Bihar consisting of the Chota Nagpur and the Santhal Parganas,
has for decades spawned movements for state autonomy. In this area are
concentrated several major tribes of India, namely Santhal, Ho, Oraon and
Munda. Unlike traditional tribes, nearly all of these practice settled plough
agriculture on the basis of family farms. Economic differentiation has set in;
there are a significant number of agricultural labourers and a growing number
of mining and industrial workers. The land-holding pattern among tribals is as
unequal and skewed as among non-tribals. A large class of moneylenders has also
developed among them. The tribal society in Jharkhand has increasingly become a
class-divided society. Most of tribals practise two formal religions—Hinduism
and Christianity. The Jharkhand tribes, however, share some features with other
Indian tribes. They have lost most of their land, generally to outsiders, and
suffer from indebtedness, loss of employment and low agricultural productivity.
They organized several major rebellions during the nineteenth century; and many
of them actively participated in the national movement after 1919. In 1951, the
Scheduled Tribes constituted 31.15 per cent of the population in Chota Nagpur
(30.94 in 1971) and 44.67 per cent of the population in the Santhal Parganas
(36.22 in 1971). </span></span></p>

nearly two-thirds of Jharkhand’s population in 1971 was non-tribal. The
overwhelming majority of both tribals and non-tribals were equally exploited
poor peasants, agricultural labourers and mining and industrial workers.
Inequality in land-holding and the moneylender menace were equally prevalent
among the two as was the commercialization of agriculture and commercial
activity. </span></span></p>

the spread of education and modern activity in the tribal areas, a movement for
the formation of a separate tribal state of Jharkhand, incorporating Chota
Nagpur and the Santhal Parganas of South Bihar and the contiguous tribal areas
of Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal, started during the late thirties and
forties. Realizing that the interests of the tribal people could be best
promoted and their domination by non-tribals ended if they had a state of their
own within the Union of India, the Jharkhand party was founded in 1950 under
the leadership of the Oxford-educated Jaipal Singh. The party achieved a
remarkable success in 1952 elections when it won 32 seats in Chota Nagpur and
emerged as the main opposition party in the Bihar Assembly. It won 25 seats in
1957. </span></span></p>

the Jharkhand party faced a major dilemma. While it demanded a state where the
tribal people would predominate, the population composition of Jharkhand was
such that they would still constitute a minority in it. To overcome this
problem the party tried to give its demand a regional character by opening its
membership to the non-tribals of the area and underplaying its anti-non-tribal
rhetoric, even while talking of the empowerment of tribals and their dominance
of the new state. The States Reorganization Commission of 1955, however,
rejected the demand for a separate Jharkhand state on the ground that the
region did not have a common language. The central government also held that
tribals being a minority in Jharkhand could not claim a state of their own. By
the early sixties the rank and file of the party began to get disheart-ened and
frustrated. The Jharkhand party could win only 20 seats to the Bihar Assembly
in 1962. In 1963, a major part of the leadership of the party, including Jaipal
Singh, joined Congress, claiming that by ‘working from within Congress’ it
stood a better chance of getting its demand for a separate state accepted by
the government. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>Several
tribal parties and movements developed in Jharkhand after 1967, the most
prominent being the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), which was formed in late
1972. The JMM revived the demand for the Jharkhand state, but it made two innovations.
It recognized the hard reality that nearly two-thirds of the population of
Jharkhand was non-tribal and that; therefore, a movement which appealed only to
the tribal people could not acquire the requisite political strength. The JMM,
therefore began to assert that all the older residents of the Jharkhand region,
whether tribal or non-tribal, were exploited, discriminated against and
dominated by North Bihar and the recent migrants. It, therefore, put forward
the demand for a separate state as a regional one on behalf of the peasants and
workers of the region. </span></span></p>

on economic issues, it also acquired the support of the nontribal poor; several
non-tribal leaders and political activists joined it, though the bulk of its
following was still that of tribals. The tribal leaders felt that despite the
minority character of tribals in the projected Jharkhand state, they would have
a far greater representation and weight in the new state than they had in Bihar
as a whole. </span></span></p>

JMM turned to a radical programme and ideology. Joined by other groups,

several militant agitations on issues such as recovery of alienated land,
moneylenders’ exploitation, employment of tribals in mines and industries and
improved working conditions and higher wages in the latter, police excesses,
high-handedness of forest officials and increasing liquor consumption. Shibu
Soren emerged as the charismatic leader of the JMM during the early seventies. </span></span></p>

with the leftists did not, however, last long; nor did the tribal/non-tribal
alliance. The movement for the Jharkhand state underwent constant ups and downs
and splits over the years with new groups coming up every so often. Major differences
among the Jharkhand leaders pertained to the question of cooperation or
alliance with the main all-India parties. Many of them believed that in
parliamentary democracy, a small number of MPs or MLAs could not on their own
easily get their demands accepted. Shibu Soren, his followers and some others
were also aware of the futility of permanently confronting state power and the
inevitable recourse to violence and armed struggle as advocated by the

movement also found it difficult to shift completely from tribal to class-based
regional politics, since it was basically built around tribal identity and
tribal demands. In particular, the policy of reservations for tribals contained
the continuing seeds of differences between tribals and non-tribals. Tribal
society was also not homogeneous; it also contained landlords, rich peasants,
traders and moneylenders. Above all, the maximum the movement was able to
extract from the ruling parties in Bihar and the Centre was a promise of
regional autonomy within the Bihar state for the Jharkhand region. In fact, as
of today, the various constituents of the Jharkhand movement have also accepted
the regional autonomy formula, with differences existing only in regard to its
exact form and content. </span></span></p>

patriotism and loyalty to a locality or region or state and its language and

They are quite consistent with national patriotism and loyalty to the nation.
To have pride in one’s region or state is also not regionalism. A person can be
conscious of his or her distinct regional identity—of being a Tamil or a
Punjabi, a Bengali or a Gujarati—without being any the less proud of being an
Indian, or being hostile to people from other regions. This was put very well
by Gandhiji in 1909: ‘As the basis of my pride as an Indian, I must have pride
in myself as a Gujarati. Otherwise, we shall be left without any moorings.’</span></span></p>

it. Also local patriotism can help people overcome divisive loyalties to caste
or religious communities. Defending the federal features of the Constitution is
also not to be seen as regionalism. The demand for a separate state within the
Indian union or for an autonomous region within an existing state, or for
devolution of power below the state level, may be objected to on several
practical grounds, but not as regionalist, unless it is put forward in a spirit
of hostility to the rest of the population of a state. If the interests of one

major threat to Indian unity because of conflict between the national

in accommodating and even celebrating—in Nehru’s words—India’s cultural
diversity. The different areas of India have had full cultural autonomy and
been enabled to fully satisfy their legitimate aspirations. The linguistic
reorganization of India and the resolution of the official language controversy
have played a very important role in this respect, by eliminating a potent
cause of the feeling of cultural loss or cultural domination and therefore of

regional disputes, of course, do exist and they have the potential of fanning

have arisen out of the formation of linguistic states as in the case of Belgaum

conflicts. But, while these disputes tend to persist for a long time and
occasionally arouse passions, they have, as a whole, remained within narrow,

in playing the role of a mediator, though sometimes drawing the anger of the
disputants on itself, but thus preventing sharper inter-regional conflicts. </span></span></p>

inequality among different states and regions could be a potential source of
trouble. However, despite breeding discontent and putting pressure on the
political system, this problem has not so far given rise to regionalism or
feeling of a region being discriminated against. At independence, the
leadership recognized that some regions were more backward than others. Only a
few enclaves or areas around Calcutta, Bombay and Madras had undergone modern
industrial development. For example, in 1948, Bombay and West Bengal accounted
for more than 59 per cent of the total industrial capital of the country and
more than 64 per cent of the national industrial output. Under colonialism,
agriculture had also stagnated, but more in eastern India than in northern or
southern India. Regional economic disparity was also reflected in per capita
income. In 1949, while West Bengal, Punjab and Bombay had per capita incomes of
Rs 353, 331 and 272 respectively, the per capita incomes of Bihar, Orissa and
Rajasthan were Rs 200, 188 and 173 </span></span></p>

the beginning, the central government adopted a whole range of policies to
influence the rates of growth in poorer states and regions so as to reduce
their economic distance from the richer states and regions. A major government
instrument in bringing this about was the transfer of financial resources to
the poorer states. Important in this respect was the role of the Finance
Commission, provided for in the Constitution and appointed periodically by the
President. The Commission decides the principles on which disbursement of
central taxes and other financial resources from the central government to the
states occurs. Various Financial Commissions have tried not only to do justice
among the states but also to reduce inter-state disparity by giving
preferential treatment to the poorer states, by allocating larger grants to
them than their population would warrant and by transferring resources from the

was also seen as powerful instrument that could be used to remove regional

development of different parts of the country, extension of the benefits of

the Planning Commission allocated greater plan assistance to the backward

backwardness of a state. Moreover, bias in favour of backward states in the
devolution of resources from the Centre to the states, in the form both of

states in regard to this investment. In the planning and location of the public
sector enterprises balanced regional growth has been an important
consideration, though this has entailed a certain economic cost to the
enterprises concerned. Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have gained the most from such
investment; Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and the north-eastern
states have also benefitted a great deal from the development of
infrastructure, especially roads. Government incentives have been provided to
the private sector to invest in backward areas through subsidies, tax
concessions, and concessional banking and institutional loans at subsidised
rates. The system of licensing of private industrial enterprises, which
prevailed from 1956 to 1991, was also used by the government to guide location
of industries in backward areas. Following nationalization of banks in 1969,
the expansion of the network of their branches was used to favour backward
areas. Banks and other public sector financial institutions were directed to
promote investment in these areas. Also, various ministries have evolved
schemes for development of backward areas. In particular, poverty eradication
programmes, such as the Food for Work programme and the Intensive Rural
Development programme, adopted since the seventies, and to some extent
education, health and family planning programmes and the public distribution
system have favoured poorer states. </span></span></p>

sector where the principle of the reduction of regional disparity has not been
kept in view is that of investment in irrigation and subsidies to agricultural
development. This has been especially so since the sixties when the Green
Revolution began and investment in rural infrastructure and technological
innovation was concentrated in Punjab, Haryana and western U.P., namely areas
where irrigation was or could be made available readily. In particular,
investment in and development of rain-fed dry land agriculture was neglected.
The result was an increase in regional agricultural disparity. The spread of
the Green Revolution technology during the seventies to Andhra Pradesh, Tamil
Nadu, Karnataka, eastern U.P. and parts of Rajasthan, and during the eighties
to the eastern states of Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa and Assam has redressed the
regional imbalance to a certain extent. </span></span></p>

would be appropriate here to ask how far have the various efforts of the
national government succeeded in reducing regional inequality. The picture that
emerges is a mixed one. There has been a marginal improvement but regional
inequality especially in terms of per capita income, continues to remain a
prominent feature of the Indian economy. Possibly, the situation would have
been much worse but for the government’s actions which has prevented the
widening of the economic gap between states and regions. There are also other
dimensions to be observed with regard to the impact of these policies. For one,
there has certainly been a decline in inter-state industrial disparity,
especially in the organized manufacturing sector. </span></span></p>

is also less disparity in terms of social welfare as represented by life
expectancy, infant mortality and literacy, though a few states like Kerala and
Tamil Nadu have moved far ahead. As we have seen above, the increased disparity
in agriculture is also gradually getting redressed though the rain-fed dry
areas are still lagging behind. While the percentage of people below the
poverty line has steadily declined in all the states it is in the advanced
states that maximum progress has been made, so that the inter-regional
disparity in the distribution of poverty has been growing. Overall, while there
has been economic growth in all states, the rates of growth of different states
have been highly differential, leading to inter-state disparities remaining
quite wide. </span></span></p>

then does regional inequality persist on such a wide scale? What are the
constraints on its decline? Or why have Bihar and U.P. performed so poorly. It
emerges that the constraint is not essentially of geography, that is, of
inequality in size or natural resources. Bihar, U.P. and Orissa are, for
example, very well endowed by nature; their people well known for their
industriousness because of which they are welcomed in the rest of the country,
and indeed overseas in the West Indies, Mauritius and Fiji to where some have
migrated. </span></span></p>

major reason, at the all-India level, for continuing regional disparity has
been the low rate of economic growth. To make a dent on this requires a high
rate of national growth so that large revenues can be raised and devoted to the

itself. </span></span></p>

rate of growth of the Indian economy was around 3.5 per cent till the end of
seventies and around 5 per cent in the eighties. This was not high enough to
have a significant impact on regional inequality despite policies consciously
designed to favour backward regions being followed. It is only in the last few
years that the rate of growth of the economy has touched 7 per cent, while
population growth has also slowed down. </span></span></p>

reduction in economic inequality may come about, provided the right type of
regional developmental policies continue to be followed. Some states’
backwardness lies in their socio-economic and political organization itself.
For example, the agrarian structure in Bihar and eastern U.P. is quite
regressive and in many parts of these states land reforms have been
inadequately implemented. (This was also true of Orissa till recently.) The
feudal mentality is still quite strong. Also, in Bihar and Orissa land
consolidation has been tardy, which played an important role in the
agricultural development of Punjab and Haryana. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>The
backward states have a lower level of infrastructural facilities, such as
power, irrigation, roads, telephones, and modern markets for agricultural
produce. These are essential for development and have to be developed by the
states themselves being mostly State subjects. States also have a low level of
social expenditure on education and public health and sanitation, which are
also State subjects. Besides, they suffer from a lack of financial resources to
meet plan expenditure. Increased central financial assistance is unable to
offset this weakness. A vicious cycle is set up. A low level of economic
development and production means less financial resources and limited
expenditure on infrastructure, development planning and social services. And
this low level of expenditure in turn leads to low levels of production and
therefore of financial resources. Political and administrative failure also
bolsters backwardness. Bihar and U.P. are classic cases of states, bedevilled
by high levels of corruption, sheer bad administration, and deteriorating law
and order. As a result whatever central assistance is available is poorly
utilized and often diverted to non-development heads of expenditure. Further,
development of infrastructure, including roads and electricity, is neglected
and the existing infrastructure is riddled with inefficiency and corruption.
All this turns away the private sector, which is a major source of development
in the advanced states. The role of greater administrative efficiency is also
proved by the better rates of economic growth in the relatively better
administered states of south and western India as compared to Bihar and U.P. </span></span></p>

passing, it maybe mentioned that disparities in development also exist within
each state. In many cases, this inequality has become a source of tension and
given birth to sub-regional movements for separate states within the Indian
union, or greater autonomy for the sub-regions within the existing states, or
at least special treatment and safeguards in matters of employment, education
and allocation of financial resources. Examples of such sub-regional feelings
are the movements in Telengana in Andhra Pradesh, Vidarbha in Maharashtra,
Saurashtra in Gujarat, Chhattisgarh in Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and
Bun-delkhand in U.P., Darjeeling district or Gorkhaland in West Bengal,
Bodoland in Assam, to a certain extent South Bihar or Jharkhand in Bihar, and
the areas consisting of the old princely states of Orissa. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>Undoubtedly,
regional economic inequality is a potent time-bomb directed against national
unity and political stability. So far, fortunately, it has been ‘digested’,
absorbed and mitigated because it is not the result of domination and
exploitation of backward states by the more advanced states or of discrimination
against the former by the national government. It is noteworthy that the
politically important Hindi-speaking states of the Indian heartland—U.P.,
Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, with nearly 37 per cent of the seats in
the Lok Sabha—are economically backward. On the other hand, Punjab, Haryana,
Gujarat and Maharashtra, with only about 17 per cent of the seats in the Lok
Sabha, are the high-income states. It is, therefore, impossible for anyone who
talks of the Hindi-belt states’ domination of the others to be taken seriously.

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>It
is interesting that so far accusations of central domination have come from the
relatively developed states of Punjab and West Bengal—obviously for political
and not economic reasons. In the all-India services too, like the IAS, the
Hindi areas are not advantaged. It is Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West
Bengal which have a higher representation than their population warrants.
Another reason for the lack of regionalism and feeling of discrimination among
the poorer states has been the consciousness of their intelligentsia that their
poverty and backwardness are basically the result of the actions of their own
political and administrative classes. After all, feelings of deprivation and
lack of progress are essentially articulated by the intelligentsia. At the same
time, the vast majority of the people in the poorer states are blissfully
unaware of their backwardness and poverty in comparison with other states. This
leads both to absence of discontent with their position as also to a lack of
effort to reach equality with the more advanced states. However, with the
spread of education and the reach of the visual and print media, such as
television and newspapers, this state of affairs is likely to change.
Nevertheless, as was fully realized by the founders of the Republic, it is
necessary to first contain regional inequality within politically and
economically reasonable and acceptable limits and then to gradually move toward
its elimination, by raising the rates of growth of the poorer states by all
available means including greater central assistance as also greater self
effort by them. This also, of course, means that, as Ajit Mazumdar has argued,
the national government needs to wield ‘greater authority than in
industrialised countries, to be able to devise and implement strategies of
economic and social development, and to deal with the problems of regional
disparities, which are more acute.’ It also must have the authority ‘to mediate
and resolve conflicts between states over the appropriation of natural
resources’ and ‘to effect significant resource transfers from richer to poorer
states. </span></span></p>

Underlying it is the view that a state specifically belongs to the main

‘homeland’ of its main language speakers who are the ‘sons of the soil’ or the
‘local’ residents. All others, who live there, or are settled there and whose

from the economic life of a state or city. The problem was aggravated in a
number of cities or regions because the speakers of the state language were in
a minority or had a bare majority. For example, in Bombay, in 1961, the
Marathi-speakers constituted 42.8 per cent of the population. In Bangalore, the
Kannada-speakers were less than 25 per cent. In Calcutta, the Bengalis formed a
bare majority. In the urban areas of Assam, barely 33 per cent were Assamese.

education as against the so-called arts education? Conflict between migrants

greater access to higher education and occupied more middle-class positions in
government service, professions and industry and were engaged in small
businesses, such as small-scale industry and shopkeeping. Active in these
movements have also been members of the lower-middle class or workers, as well
as rich and middle peasants whose position is unthreatened, but who

for gaining political power. This was not of course inevitable. The Communist
party refused to use anti-migrant sentiments in Calcutta because of its
ideological commitment, one reason why the city has not witnessed any major
‘sons of the soil’ movement. Similarly, though Congress may have taken an
op-portunist and compromising stand when faced with major ‘sons of the soil’
movements, it has not initiated or actively supported them. ‘Outsiders’ have
been often far more numerous in rural areas as agricultural labourers or as
workers in low-paid traditional industries, such as jute or cotton textiles,
than in the cities. </span></span></p>

however, ‘the sons of the soil’ sentiment was absent, nor hostility towards the

migration of labourers from Bihar and U.P. to Punjab and Haryana or Bombay
city, or of workers from Bihar to the jute and other mills of Calcutta, or of
workers from Bihar and Orissa to the tea plantations in Assam and Bengal, or of
Oriya building workers to Gujarat, and domestic workers all over India. Such
migrations have not posed a threat to the local middle classes; and in the last

factor that has influenced the emergence or non-emergence of anti-migrant

have flourished in Maharashtra, Assam and the Telengana area of Andhra Pradesh,
the people of which have not had a tradition of migration. The Indian
Constitution is to some extent ambiguous on the question of the rights of the
migrants. Article 15 prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of religion,
race, caste, sex or place of birth. Article 16 prohibits discrimination in the
employment or appointments to any office under the state on grounds of
‘descent, place of birth or residence’. However, the parliament, though not any
state legislature, can pass a law laying down the requirement of residence
within a state for appointments under that state. Under political pressure and
taking advantage of the ambiguity in the Constitution, many states, in fact
reserve jobs, or give preference for employment in state and local governments
and for admission into educational institutions to local residents. The period
of residence is fixed or prescribed in such cases. Also, while the Constitution
permits reservation or preference in state jobs only on grounds of residence
and not language, some state governments have gone further and limited the
preference to those local residents whose mother tongue is the state language.
They have thus discriminated against long-term migrants, their descendants, and
even the residents who can speak the state language but whose mother tongue is
a minority language in the state. This has, of course, been in clear violation
of the Constitution. Many state governments have also given directions to
private employers to give preference to local persons for employment in their
enterprises. </span></span></p>

main argument put forward for reservation in employment and education for the
local persons has been that in the states concerned they are socially,
economically and educationally backward and are not able to compete with the
more advanced migrant communities. Also, in technical colleges and
universities, the more backward local students would be overwhelmed by the more
advanced students from other states. It is because of this, in the post-Nehru
era, even the central government has tended to support preference for residents
of a state in employment in central public sector enterprises below the level
of a certain technical expertise and in colleges and universities. Reservations
on grounds of residence have also been approved by the courts. However, as
brought out earlier, reservations for the tribal people are in a separate
category. </span></span></p>

reservation of jobs in state administrations and seats in institutions of

point of view of national integration, some justification could be found for
it. However, there was none for the anti-migrant movements of the sixties which
tried to restrict the flow of migrants from other states and which openly
proclaimed antagonism and generated hostility against them. These militant
anti-migrant and ‘sons of the soil’ movements were mainly centered in the urban

the Shiv Sena organized a militant,, and often violent movement against the
South Indians, especially the Tamils, who were declared to have a
disproportionate share of office jobs such as clerks and typists in private
firms and small businesses such as tea shops and eating places. In 1969, the
Sena gave the Bombay city a taste of violence when it organized arson against
South Indians, looted and destroyed their tea-stalls and eating places,
overturned cars of Tamils and tore off Tamil signs from shops. The Shiv Sena
could not, however, sustain its hate-South Indian campaign or become a major
political force outside Bombay city or get the support of any all-India

‘sons of the soil’ movements in Assam and Telengana, which also assumed serious
proportions and were quite complex, had some additional and distinctive
features. While protective and preferential regulations have been widespread
since the late sixties, antagonism, hostility and violence against migrants
have abated in recent years. The problem posed by ‘the sons of the soil’
doctrine is still somewhat a minor one and there is no ground for pessimism on
that score. Even at its height, only a few cities and states were affected in a
virulent form, and at no stage did it threaten the unity of the country or the process
of nation-in-the-making. Besides, its effects on the Indian economy have been
negligible: migration within the country has not been checked; inter-state
mobility is in fact growing. But the problem is likely to linger till economic
development is able to deal effectively with unemployment, especially among the
middle classes, and regional inequality. </span></span></p>

inequality and regionalism, it is to be observed that the prophets of ‘gloom
and doom’ have been disproved. Linguistic states have strengthened not weakened
Indian unity, even while permitting full cultural autonomy to different
linguistic areas. Hindi and English are growing as all-India languages.
Regional movements like the DMK have been doused after 1967 and are content to
rename Madras state, Tamil Nadu and Madras as Chennai. Tribals feel secure in
the Indian union regarding their cultural and economic autonomy; have also
gained greater strength themselves, as also political support in the country
over time. The process of nation-in-the-making is being pushed forward. </span></span></p>

India’s past experience in overcoming disruptive forces may be instructive for
the future. The role and legacy of the freedom struggle, the quality and wisdom
of the leaders, the leadership’s correct understanding of India’s diversity,
the leadership’s rejection of secessionist demands, while respecting those
within the constitutional framework, the democratic political structure, and
the acceptance of the need for a strong national government within a federal
structure have all contributed to promote Indian unity. Here, it must be added
that a strong state should not be mistaken for an authoritarian one. A strong
national government does not entail weak state governments or a national
government that rides roughshod over the federal provisions of the
Constitution. Federalism does not mean a weak national government, rather a
non-dominating national government which observes the federal features of the
polity. A strong but democratic nation state is a necessity for a developing
country with strong federal features. What it does with its strength depends on
the political nature of the government and the ruling party of the day. </span></span></p>

polity and the economy. People experienced an advance towards the basic

regarding the slow pace of development, especially with regard to the problems
of poverty and employment, and the slow and unsatisfactory progress of land
reforms. Among the several areas of progress and achievement, though marked by

on the traditions of the national movement, the Indian leaders further

the democratic system so that gradually attachment of people to parliamentary

democratic institutions and procedures. Nehru, in particular, despite holding
complete sway saw to it that political power was widely dispersed and diffused.

every effort to sustain its dignity, prestige and power, even though his party
enjoyed an overwhelming majority in it. He tried to make it a major forum for
expression of public opinion, and made it a point to sit through the Question
Hour and to attend parliamentary debates. The Opposition too played its part by
respecting the parliament and its procedures, functioning without fear in its
portals, and keeping the standard of parliamentary debates at a high level.
Moreover, parliamentary committees such as the Estimates Committee began to
play an important role as critics of, and watchdogs over, the government
administration. </span></span></p>

and respect. C. D. Deshmukh, India’s Finance Minister from 1950 to 1956,

were able to take advantage of the fact that the Congress was not a monolithic
party and encompassed within itself several political and ideological trends.
They were able to influence the government policies by influencing the
different ideological strands in the Congress. Nehru also respected and
promoted internal democracy and debate within the Congress party and encouraged
it to accommodate new social forces and trends. </span></span></p>

provided for in the Constitution, also was established as a firm feature of
Indian polity during the Nehru years, with a genuine devolution of power to the
states. Respecting the states’ autonomy, Nehru would not impose decisions on
the state governments or interfere with their policies, though he took care to
inform them of his own thinking and occasionally advise or even insist on their
acceptance of a particular policy. He also permitted the state Congress parties
to choose their party and government leaders. He relied upon the state leaders
and governments to understand better their own intricate problems. In the
process, he was willing to put up with a great deal. In fact, one reason why
Nehru would not go too far in forcing the states to effect land reforms the way
he conceived them was because land reforms were a State subject and he would
not ride roughshod over the states’ rights and powers even for a favourite
cause of his. Nehru would guide and advise and urge but would not step out of
constitutional boundaries; he would observe constitutional niceties in spirit
and form. In fact, a major reason for the weaknesses of the agricultural,
educational, health and other social welfare programs lay in the Centre’s dependence
on the states for their implementation, for these were State subjects. At the
same time, Nehru did not permit any weakening of the prestige or authority of
the central government. He always maintained a sharp distinction between
centralization of power or Centre’s domination of the states and a strong
Centre needed for nation building and maintenance of the unity and independence
of the country as also to keep under check disruptive and divisive forces. </span></span></p>

major reason that led to the development of harmonious relations between the
Centre and the states and which kept in check centrifugal forces was the fact
that the same party ruled in both places. The leading role of the Centre was
also facilitated by the fact that some of the tallest men and women in Indian
politics held office in the Cabinet as well as the Congress Working Committee.
The tradition of the supremacy of the civil government over the armed forces
was fully established during these years. The Indian armed forces had been
traditionally non-political and had accepted civilian control and leadership.
But the continuation of this role by them was not guaranteed. Nehru, in
particular, was worried about the possibility of the armed forces intervening
in politics and the government in case of exceptional circumstances, as
happened in nineteenth century France and Germany and recently in many Third
World countries. To avoid such a possibility in India he took several steps in
this regard. He kept the size of the armed forces relatively small; refusing to
permit their expansion even after large-scale US military aid to Pakistan began
in 1954. The expenditure on the defence forces was also kept extremely low,
less than two per cent of the national income. </span></span></p>

the British colonial practice of recruiting men in the army on the criteria of
‘martial’ classes, the armed forces were given a heterogeneous character, with
almost every region and section of society being represented in them. India was
thus protected from the danger of militarism in its formative years. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>The
small size of the armed forces and of expenditure on them were also prompted by
two other considerations: avoidance of diversion of scarce resources from
economic development; and given the absence of domestic defence industries, to
avoid dependence on foreign powers and the possibility of their intervention in
India’s internal and foreign affairs. One blemish, though not a simple one, on
the democratic record of the Nehru years occurred when the Communist government
in Kerala was dismissed in 1959 and President’s Rule was imposed in the state. </span></span></p>

after independence, it was to be decided whether the government of independent
India should carry on with the administrative structure and machinery inherited
from the colonial regime and ‘designed to serve the relatively simple interests
of an occupying power.’ The kingpin of this structure was the Indian Civil
Service (ICS). If the structure was to be replaced or overhauled, the beginning
had to be made with the ICS. Initially, there were differences in approach to
the question between Nehru and Patel, who, as Home Minister, dealt directly
with the administrative services. Nehru was a staunch critic of the ICS and
bureaucracy as a whole not only because of their colonial ancestry but also
because of their basic conservatism. In 1946, he had described the existing
administrative structure as ‘the ship of State’ which was ‘old and battered and
slow-moving and unsuited to this age of swift change.’ He declared that ‘it
will have to be scrapped and give place to another.’ Patel, on the other hand
felt that retention of the existing administrative machinery was necessary in
the then troubled times when it seemed that internal stability was in danger
and chaos imminent. He was not in favour of a sudden discontinuity and vacuum
in administration, particularly as the ICS and other all-India services
provided the only trained personnel available. Defending the all-India services
in the Constituent Assembly in 1949, Patel said:</span></span></p>

accepted Patel’s position, though grudgingly, for he too realized that there
was no alternative to reliance on the existing all-India services if a
breakdown of administration was to be avoided. Over time he too began to rely
heavily on these services, admiring their administrative efficiency, especially
as he realized that the other available human resources were rather poor. Many,
following Lenin in the State and Revolution, have argued that the existing
state administrative apparatus should have been ‘smashed’ or dismantled and
that it was perhaps quite easy to do so in the very beginning of a new state.
We think that in light of India’s and other countries’ historical experience
there is little doubt that having well-trained, versatile and experienced civil
services at the outset when the country was in turmoil was a distinct asset and
advantage to India; and that they did give a good account of themselves in the
troubled post-Partition years. However, while retention of the existing
bureaucracy and the administrative structure was inevitable and perhaps even
sound under the circumstances, the failure to ‘rebuild and transform their
character’ was clearly a liability. The administrative structure had been built
during the colonial period largely to maintain law and order and to collect
land revenue. It had to be overhauled, however gradually, to suit the needs of
a democratic and developing society and made capable of executing the new
economic and social welfarist policies. </span></span></p>

in particular was fully aware of the inadequacy of the existing bureaucracy to
understand the problems of the people and to implement the new tasks. As early
as 1951 he complained: ‘We rely more and more on official agencies which are
generally fairly good, but which are completely different in outlook and
execution from anything that draws popular enthusiasm to it.’ He was convinced
that the situation could be remedied in two ways: ‘One, by educating the whole
machine. Secondly, by putting a new type of person where it is needed.’ But
neither of two steps was actually taken. Rather, the new IAS was formed very
much in the old ICS mould and this pattern was followed all down the
bureaucratic structure. For example, the few who joined the Community
Development projects out of idealism and social commitment were soon frustrated
when they discovered that they were being dominated, looked down upon and
treated as low-paid underlings by the traditional, higher bureaucrats. </span></span></p>

administration not only did not improve over the years, it deteriorated further
becoming more inefficient and inaccessible. The attitude of the bureaucracy,
especially the police, towards the people and their problems also became
increasingly unhelpful. Above all, there was the evil of corruption. There were
major signals in the Nehru era that political and administrative corruption was
beginning to burgeon. In the fifties, however, the tentacles of corruption were
not yet far-reaching and checks existed in the form of a political leadership
and cadres having roots in the freedom struggle and Gandhian ethos, a large,
honest bureaucracy, especially in its middle and higher rungs, and a judiciary
having a high level of integrity It was, therefore, still possible to squash
the evil with a certain ease. Nehru and other leaders were aware of the
problems relating to public administration. In May 1948, Nehru drew the
attention of the chief ministers to complaints from the public ‘about our
inefficiency, inaccessibility, delays and, above all, of corruption,’ and
added: ‘I fear that many of these complaints are justified.’ Similarly, in his
last letter to the chief ministers in May 1963, he pointed to the need to
‘strengthen our Government apparatus and to fight a ceaseless war against
corruption and inefficiency.’ And he added:</span></span></p>

also took concrete action whenever a case of corruption involving his ministers
was made out. But he was chary of carrying out a campaign against corruption
lest it create a general atmosphere of suspicion and accusations, to which he
felt Indians were already too susceptible, and thus prevent officials and
ministers from taking timely decisions and assuming responsibility. </span></span></p>

view was reiterated in the Scientific Policy Resolution passed by the Lok Sabha
in March 1958 ac-knowledging the role of science and technology in the economic
social and cultural advancement of the country. After 1947, Nehru also became
aware of the critical role that scientific research and technology would play in
India’s defence. As part of the effort to promote self-sustaining scientific
and technological growth, the foundation stone of India’s first national
laboratory, the National Physical Laboratory, was laid on 4 January 1947. This
was followed by the setting up during the Nehru years of a network of seventeen
national laboratories, specializing in different areas of research. To
emphasize the importance of science and scientific research, Nehru himself
assumed the chairmanship of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research,
which guided and financed the national laboratories and other scientific
institutions. </span></span></p>

the years scientific research began, however, to suffer because the
organization and management structure of the scientific institutes was highly
bureaucratic and hierarchical, breeding factionalism and in-58 trigue as also
frustration among their personnel. This became a major factor in the brain
drain of scientists that began in the late fifties. India was one of the first
nations to recognize the importance of nuclear energy. Nehru was convinced that
nuclear energy would bring about a global revolution in the social, economic
and political spheres, besides affecting nations’ defence capabilities. In
August 1948, the Government of India set up the Atomic Energy Commission with
Homi J. Bhabha, India’s leading nuclear scientist, as chairman, in the
Department of Scientific Research, which was under Nehru’s direct charge, to
develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In 1954, the government created a
separate Department of Atomic Energy under the prime minister with Homi Bhabha
as Secretary. India’s first nuclear reactor in Trombay, Bombay, also the first
in Asia, became critical in August 1956. Her on-going and fairly well advanced
nuclear programme included the setting up of several nuclear plants to produce
electricity in a few years time. Though India was committed to the peaceful
uses of nuclear power, its nuclear capacity could easily have been used to
produce the atomic bomb and other atomic weapons. </span></span></p>

also took up space research. It set up the Indian National Committee for Space
Research (INCOSPAR) in 1962 and established a Rocket Launching Facility at
Thumba (TERLS). Krishna Menon, as Defence Minister, took steps to initiate
defence research and development. Steps were also taken to increase India’s
capacity in production of defence equipment so that India gradually became
self-sufficient in its defence needs. India also changed over to decimal
coinage and a metric system of weights and measures, despite dire warnings that
an illiterate population could not handle the change. </span></span></p>

society had to move towards social change. Article 36 of the Constitution in
the section on the Directive Principles of State Policy stated: ‘The state
shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as
effectively as may be a social order in which justice, economic and political,
shall inform all institutions of the national life.’ This conception of the new
social order was encompassed in 1955 by the phrase ‘socialistic pattern of
society’ officially accepted by the Congress at its Avadi Session and later
incorporated as its objective in the Second and Third Five Year Plans.
Consequently, several important measures of social reforms, which some have
described as the beginning of a welfare state, were taken during the Nehru
years. Very important measures in this respect were those of land reforms, the
initiation of planned economic development and rapid expansion of the public
sector. In addition far-reaching labour legislation was undertaken, including
recognition of collective bargaining, the right to form trade unions and to go
on strike, security of employment and provision of health and accident
insurance. There were also moves towards a more equitable distribution of
wealth through progressive and steep income-tax and excise tax policies.
Expansion of education and health and other social services, was also sought. </span></span></p>

and other leaders were also keen to ensure that Indian social organization
underwent change, leading to the social liberation of the hitherto socially
backward and suppressed sections of society. As Nehru put it in 1956: ‘We have
not only striven for and achieved a political revolution, not only are we
striving hard for an economic revolution but … we are equally intent on social
revolution; only by way of advance on these three separate lines and their
integration into one great whole, will the people of India progress.’</span></span></p>

Constitution had already incorporated a provision abolishing untouchability.
The government supplemented this provision by passing the Anti-Untouchability
Law in 1955 making the practice of untouchability punishable and a cognizable
offence. The government also tried to implement the clauses of the Constitution
regarding reservations in educational institutions and government employment in
favour of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) and other weaker
sections of society. Other necessary measures were taken to raise their social
status, such as the provision of special facilities in the form of
scholarships, hostels accommodation, grants, loans, housing, health care and
legal-aid services. A Commissioner of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was
appointed to monitor the effective implementation of all such measures and
constitutional provisions. However, in spite of all these steps, the SCs and
STs continued to be backward and caste oppression was still widely prevalent,
especially in rural areas, where the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes also
formed a large part of the landless agricultural labour, and therefore also
suffered from class oppression. There was also hardly any effort to eradicate
the ideology of the caste system or to remove caste inequality and caste
oppression so that casteism began to spread from the upper castes to the
backward castes and from the rural to the urban areas. </span></span></p>

before independence, Nehru had made his position on this issue clear and quoted
Charles Fourier, the French philosopher: ‘One could judge the degree of civilization
of a country by the social and political position of its women.’ A major step
forward in this direction was taken when the Hindu Code Bill was moved in the
parliament in 1951. The bill faced sharp opposition from conservative sectors
of society, especially from Jan Sangh and other Hindu communal organizations.
Even though actively supported by the vocal members of Congress party and women
MPs and other women activists, Nehru decided to postpone enactment of the bill
in order to mobilize greater support for it. He was, however, firm in his
determination to pass the bill and made it an issue in the elections of
1951-52. </span></span></p>

coming back to power, the government passed the bill in the form of four
separate acts which introduced monogamy and the right of divorce to both men
and women, raised the age of consent and marriage, and gave women the right to
maintenance and to inherit family property. A revolutionary step was thus taken
for women’s liberation, though its practice would take decades to take full
effect. An important lacu-na in this respect was that a uniform civil code
covering the followers of all religions was not enacted. This would have
involved changes in Muslim personal law regarding monogamy and inheritance.
There was strong opposition to this from the Muslim orthodoxy. The process of
social reform among Muslims had in the modern period lagged far behind that
among Hindus and consequently social change had been quite slow even among
middle-class Muslim women. Nehru was not willing to alarm the Muslim minority
which was, he believed, even otherwise under pressure. He would make changes in
Muslim personal law and enact a uniform civil code but only when Muslims were
ready for it. </span></span></p>

founding fathers were fully aware of the need for better and wider education as
an instrument of social and economic progress, equalization of opportunity and
the building up of a democratic society. This was all the more urgent because
in 1951 only 16.6 per cent of the total population was literate and the percentage
was much lower, being only 6 per cent, in the case of rural families. To remedy
this situation, the Constitution directed that by 1961 the state should provide
free and compulsory education to every child up to the age of fourteen. Later,
this target was shifted to 1966. The government provided large sums for
developing primary, secondary, higher and technical education: while the
expenditure on education was Rs 198 million in 1952-52, by 1964-65 it had
increased to Rs 1462.7 million, i.e. by more than seven times. </span></span></p>

education was primarily a state subject, Nehru urged the state governments not

could be reduced. He told the National Development Council in May 1961: ‘I have
come to feel that it (education) is the bases of all and, on no account unless
actually our heads are cut off and we cannot function, must we allow education
to suffer.’</span></span></p>

the time of independence there were eighteen universities with a total student

to fifty-four, the number of colleges to about 2,500 and the number of
undergraduate and post-graduate students, excluding intermediate students, to
613,000. The number of girls students increased six-fold and constituted 22 per
cent of the total. However, the progress in primary education, though
recognizable, did not match the needs or the intentions especially as the
number of eligible students was growing fast because of the high rate of
population growth. The constitutional target of free and compulsory education
to all children was first shifted from 1961 to 1966 </span></span></p>

then to a distant future. By the end of the Third Plan in 1965-66 only 61 per
cent of the children between six and fourteen were in school, the figure for
girls being only 43 per cent. Consequently, widespread illiteracy continued; as
late as 1991 only 52 per cent of the Indians were literate. </span></span></p>

these figures do not tell the full story. In 1965, five per cent of the rural
population was not served by any school at all. Moreover, the facilities
provided in the existing schools were very poor, with majority of schools
having no pucca building, blackboards or drinking water. Nearly 40 per cent of
primary schools had only one teacher to take three or four classes. A
particular malady of primary schooling was the high rate of dropouts. Nearly
half of those enrolled in class I would have left school by the time they
reached class IV and been rapidly reduced to virtual illiteracy again.
Moreover, the dropout rate was higher in case of girls than the boys. Clearly,
there was no equal opportunity in education and therefore also hardly any
equalization of opportunity in work and employment for the poor and those in
the rural areas who constituted the vast majority of the Indian people. A major
weakness that crept in was the decline in educational standards. Despite
recognition of the problem, except for the technology sector, the educational
system was left untouched and unreformed and the quality of education continued
to deteriorate, first in schools and then in colleges and universities. The
ideological content of education also continued to be the same as in the
colonial period. </span></span></p>

was aware of the unsatisfactory progress in education and near the end of his
prime ministership began to put greater emphasis on its development, especially
of primary education, which, he now stressed, should, be developed at any cost.
‘In the final analysis’, he wrote to the chief ministers in 1963, ‘right
education open to all is perhaps the basic remedy for most of our ills.’ Also,
‘In spite of my strong desire for the growth of our industry, I am convinced
that it is better to do without some industrial growth then to do without

designed for the sake of agricultural development, they had more of a welfare

the quality of life of the people. The Community Development programme was
instituted on a limited scale in 1952 covering 55 development blocs, each bloc
consisting of about 100 villages with a population of sixty to seventy
thousand. By the mid-sixties most of the country was covered by a network of
community blocs, employing more than 6,000 Block Development Officers (BDOs)
and over 600,000 Village Level Workers (VLWs or Gram Sewaks) to help implement
the programme. The programme covered all aspects of rural life from improvement
in agricultural methods to improvement in communications, health and education.

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>The
emphasis of the programme was on self-reliance and self-help by the people,
popular participation and responsibility. It was to be basically a people’s
movement for their own welfare. As Nehru stated at the very outset of the
programme in 1952, the basic objective was ‘to unleash forces from below among
our people.’ </span></span></p>

it was ‘necessary to plan, to direct, to organize and to coordinate; but it
[was] even more necessary to create conditions in which a spontaneous growth
from below [was] possible.’ While material achievements were expected, the
programme was much more geared ‘to build up the community and the individual
and to make the latter a builder of his own village centre and of India in the
larger sense.’ ‘The primary matter is the human being involved,’ he added.
Another major objective was to uplift the backward sections: ‘We must aim at
progressively producing a measure of equality in opportunity and other things.’
In 1952 and in the later years, Nehru repeatedly referred to the Community
Development programme and the accompanying National Extension Service as
representing ‘new dynamism’ and a ‘great revolution.’ and as ‘symbols of the
resurgent spirit of India.’</span></span></p>

programme achieved considerable results in extension work: better seeds,
fertilizers, and so on, resulting in agricultural development in general and
greater food production, in particular, construction of roads, tanks and walls,
school and primary health centre buildings, and extension of educational and
health facilities. Initially, there was also a great deal of popular
enthusiasm, which, however, petered out with time. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>It
soon became apparent that the programme had failed in one of its basic
objectives—that of involving the people as full participants in developmental
activity. Not only did it not stimulate self-help, it increased expectations
from and reliance on the government. It gradually acquired an official
orientation, became part of the bureaucratic framework and came to be
administered from above as a routine activity with the BDOs becoming replicas
of the traditional sub-divisional officers and the Village Level Workers
becoming administrative underlings. As Nehru put it later in 1963, while the
entire programme was designed to get the peasant ‘out of the rut in which he
has been living since ages past,’ the programme itself ‘has fallen into a rut.’
The weaknesses of the programme had come to be known as early as 1957 when the
Balwantrai Mehta Committee, asked to evaluate it, had strongly criticized its
bureaucratization and its lack of popular involvement. As a remedy, the
Committee recommended the democratic decentralization of the rural and district
development administration. On the Committee’s recommendation, it was decided
to introduce, all over the country, an integral system of democratic
self-government with the village panchayat at its base. The new system, which
came to be known as Panchayati Raj and was implemented in various states from
1959, was to consist of a three-tier, directly elected village or gram
panchayats, and indirectly elected bloc-level panchayat samitis and
district-level zila Parishads. The Community Development programme was to be
integrated with the Panchayati Raj; considerable functions, resources and
authority were to be devolved upon the three-tiered samitis to carry out
schemes of development. Thus, the Panchayati Raj was intended to make up a
major deficiency of the Community Development programme by providing for
popular participation in the decision-making and implementation of the
development process with the officials working under the guidance of the
three-level samitis. Simultaneously, the countryside was covered by thousands
of cooperative institutions such as cooperative banks, land mortgage banks and
service and market cooperatives, which were also autonomous from the
bureaucracy as they were managed by elected bodies. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>Nehru’s
enthusiasm was once again aroused as Panchayati Raj and cooperative
institutions represented another radical step for change in society. They would
transfer responsibility for development and rural admininistrations to the
people and accelerate rural development. They would thus let as instruments for
the empowerment of the people and would not only lead to greater self-reliance,
but would also act as an educative tool, for bringing about a change in the
outlook of the people. Above all, they would initiate the process of creating
better human beings. However, these hopes were belied. Though adopting
Panchayati Raj in one form or another, the state governments showed little
enthusiasm for it, devolved no real power on the Panchayati samitis, curbed
their powers and functions and starved them of funds. The bureaucracy too did
not slacken its grip on rural administration at different levels. Panchayats
were also politicized and used by politicians to gather factional support in
the villages. As a result, though foundations of a system of rural local
self-government were laid, democratic decentralization as a whole was stunted
and could not perform the role assigned to it by the Balwantrai Mehta Committee
and Jawaharlal Nehru. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Hlk56938915'><span lang=EN>Moreover,
the benefits of community development, new agricultural inputs and the
extension services were mostly garnered by the rich peasants and capitalist
farmers, who also came to dominate the Panchayati Raj institutions. The basic
weakness of the Community Development programme, the Panchayati Raj and the
cooperative movement was that they ignored the class division of the rural
society where nearly half the population was landless or had marginal holdings
and was thus quite powerless. The village was dominated socially and
economically by the capitalist farmers and the rich and middle peasantry; and
neither the dominant rural classes nor the bureaucrats could become agents of
social transformation or popular participation. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>India’s effort to pursue an independent
foreign policy was a highlight of post-1947 politics. A product of its long
history and recent past, this policy was marked by a great deal of consistency
and continuity. Despite revolutionary changes in the international situation,
the broad parameters which were evolved during the freedom struggle and in the
early years of independence still retain their validity. Jawaharlal Nehru
stands as the architect of this not mean achievement. He realized that given
her great civilization, India could not but aspire to the right to speak in her
own voice. Her recent, hard-won freedom from the colonial yoke would also be
meaningless unless it found expression in the international arena. Being
sub-continental in size, too, ruled out an assumption of client status for
India. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>An independent voice was not merely a
choice, it was an imperative. It was Nehru who gave this voice a shape in the
form of the idea of nonalignment and an organizational cohesion through the
non-aligned movement. The immediate context for emergence of this movement was
the division of the world into two hostile blocs after World War II, one led by
the US and the western powers and the other by the Soviet Union. Nehru’s
understanding was that newly independent, poor countries of Asia and Africa had
nothing to gain and everything to lose by falling for the temptation of joining
the military blocs of the big powers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

contests for power of no relevance to them. Their needs were to fight poverty,
and illiteracy and disease, and these could not be met by joining military
blocs. On the contrary, India and other similarly placed countries needed peace
and quiet to get on with the business of development. Their interests lay in
expanding the ‘area of peace’, not of war, or hostility. India, therefore,
neither joined nor approved of the Baghdad Pact, the Manila Treaty, SEATO, and
CENTO which joined the countries of West and East Asia to the western power
bloc. </span></p>

or staying out of military blocs. Nehru was quick to reject the charge of
‘immoral neutrality’ hurled at India by <span class=0Text>John Foster Dulles</span>.
Non-alignment meant having the freedom to decide each issue on its merits, to
weigh what was right or wrong and then take a stand in favour of right. To
quote:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Non-alignment came to symbolize the
struggle of India and other newly independent nations to retain and strengthen
their independence from colonialism and imperialism. India being the first to
become independent, rightly gave the lead to other ex-colonies in this respect.
And collectively these nations counted for a great deal. In the UN for example,
whose membership had swollen with their entry, the one country, one vote system
enabled the non-aligned bloc, often helped by the Soviets, to check domination
by the western bloc. Non-alignment thus advanced the process of democratization
of international relations. A basic objective of Indian foreign policy, that of
extending support to colonial and ex-colonial countries in their struggle
against colonialism, was well served by the policy of non-alignment. Another
objective that of promoting world peace was also facilitated by it. Nehru’s passionate
opposition to war and the threat of nuclear conflict which loomed large after
Hiroshima is well known. It grew out of his experience of non-violent struggle
and his conviction in Gandhi who had resolved to make it his mission to fight
and outlaw the atom bomb. </span></p>

and believed that nobody had a monopoly on the truth and plural-ism was a fact
of life. To this end he outlined the five principles of peaceful coexistence,
or Panch Sheel, for conducting relations among countries. These were mutual
respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression,
non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit,
and peaceful co-existence. While Nehru tirelessly articulated his ideas about
international conduct of nations in every available forum, there were some
landmark moments in his quest. Before independence, in March 1947, at his
inspiration, an Asian Relations Conference attended by more than twenty
countries was held in Delhi. The tone of the conference was Asian independence
and assertion on the world stage. While this conference concerned itself with
general issues, the next one was called in response to a very specific problem:
the Dutch attempt to re-colonize Indonesia in December 1948. Nehru invited

the next challenge the world faced was that of preventing a nuclear war. A
major function of Indian foreign policy was to promote and protect Indian
economic interests and to facilitate her on the path that she had chosen for
herself. Non-alignment, by not tying India to any one bloc, enabled her to
develop economic ties with countries on both sides of the divide as and when
she needed. She needed and got capital, technology, machines and food from the
western countries. She also relied, especially after 1954, on the Soviet Union
for building up her public sector industries, something which the US was

Indian foreign policy sometimes linked apparently irreconciliable goals. For
example, the Soviet Union and India initiated in 1963 and signed in August
1964, August 1965 and November 1965 major arms deals by which the Soviet Union
became the largest arms supplier to India and Indo-Soviet relations entered a
qualitatively new phase. At the same time, India decided to adopt the Green
Revolution technology for agricultural development which was backed by the US.
The arms deals with the Soviet Union and the Green Revolution which led to
India becoming self-sufficient in food in a few years time increased India’s
capacity to stand on her own feet and take a more independent stand in world
affairs. Similarly, both the US and the Soviet Union at different times agreed
to be paid in rupees, thus saving India precious hard currency. </span></p>

Britain dominating over her, India could benefit from her presence in a
multinational body. Besides, membership of the Commonwealth provided a certain
security in a situation when India was yet to find out who her friends (and
enemies) were going to be. India also played an active role in the UN

controlled by the Socialist camp and a South Korea dominated by the Western
powers. K.P.S. Menon, who was elected Chairman of the United Nations Commission
on Korea in late 1947, had in his report to the UN appealed ‘to the great
powers to let Korea be united’, warning that else ‘Korea may blow up’ but it
was to no avail. When North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, India-supported
the US in the UN Security Council, condemning North Korea as aggressor and
calling for a ceasefire. But American pleasure was soon to turn into anger when
they found that India abstained from voting on another resolution calling for
assistance to South Korea and the setting up of a unified command for this
purpose. India’s main concern was to prevent the entry of outside powers into
the conflict. Nehru appealed to Truman and Stalin and received a warm response
from the latter. </span></p>

head of US forces under UN command, after pushing North Korean forces out of
South Korea, without the approval of the UN, crossed the 38th parallel into
North Korea and continued towards the Yalu River that separated Korea from
China. Chou En-lai, the Chinese prime minister warned the western powers
through the Indian ambassador to China, K.M. Panikkar, of retaliation, but to
no avail. (India was the only link between the West and East in Peking at that
time.) China thereupon sent in waves of armed ‘volunteers’ and succeeded in
pushing back American troops to south of the 38th parallel, which resulted in huge
Chinese, Korean and American casualties. Nehru tried again at this point to
bring about an end to the war by organizing a conference but the US queered the
pitch with an ill-timed UN resolution declaring China the aggressor. India
voted against it because it was clearly MacArthur and not China who was the
aggressor in North Korea. A military stalemate ensued but despite India’s
tireless efforts it took till June 1953 to get both sides to agree to a
ceasefire and evolve an acceptable formula for the repatriation of prisoners of
war. It was Krishna Menon who finally succeeded in fashioning a formula that
the General Assembly of the UN and, after Stalin’s death, the Soviet bloc
accepted. A Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was set up with an Indian, General

in non-alignment and commitment to peace to the utmost, and she had not been
found wanting. She stoically faced first Chinese and Soviet hostility because
she voted to declare North Korea the initial aggressor. She then endured
American wrath for refusing to go along with western intervention in the war,
and for refusing to declare China the aggressor. In the midst of this, in 1950,
China invaded Tibet and annexed it without any effort to keep India in the
picture. Though upset, Nehru did not allow this to influence his stand on the
Korean War. India continued to press the UN to recognize and give a seat to
Communist China in the Security Council, especially now that the USSR had
withdrawn from it in protest. India also badly needed food aid from the US to
meet the near famine conditions at home but did not allow this to blind it to
US stance in Korea. She continued to press ahead even if success was not always
apparent. In the end, India’s stand was vindicated both sides had to recognize
the same boundary they had tried to change. The world now recognized the worth of
non-alignment. It was difficult to dismiss it as mealy-mouthed, cowardly
neutrality or as idealist hogwash. The USSR clearly began to see India in a
different light. The Soviet Prime Minister, Bulganin, even told the Indian
ambassador, K.P.S. Menon, that the USSR ‘fully appreciated India’s position in
the Commonwealth and hoped that India would continue to remain in it.’ This was
a big change from the time when the membership of the Commonwealth was seen as

Geneva Conference on Indo-China (to which India was not invited as a member).
These steps, besides Nehru’s meeting with Chou En-Lai in 1954 in Delhi, and
other behind-the-scenes parleys and assurances helped prevent the further
internationalization of the Indo-Chinese conflict. India obtained guarantees
from China for the neutralization of Laos and Cambodia and promises from Great
Britain and France to China that they would not allow the US to have bases in
Laos and Cambodia. The significance of India’s role in the negotiations was
evident from the reference by Pierre Mendes-France, the French prime minister,
to the Geneva Conference as ‘this ten-power conference—nine at the table—and
India’. At China’s request, India was appointed Chairman of the International
Control Commission and its work included supervision of imports of foreign
armaments into Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. For the time being, the danger of
the Chinese intervening on behalf of the Viet Minh and of the US increasing its
support to the French, even to the point of introducing nuclear weapons into
the region, was averted. France was tired of the war, Britain apprehensive of
bellicose US intentions, and the USSR, particularly after Stalin’s death,
groping towards ‘peaceful coexistence’. While the control commissions were
later subverted through US diplomacy, and Indo-China became a major Cold War
theatre, all subsequent peace efforts in fact took up solutions prescribed by
Nehru. </span></p>

withdrawal of the promised financial aid for building the Aswan Dam on the

canal and Britain and France particularly demanded international control over
it. India was a major user herself but she recognized that under the
Constantinople Convention (1888) the Suez Canal was an integral part of Egypt.
She urged both Cairo and London to observe restraint and tried at the London
Conference in August 1956 to get agreement on a formula that included Egyptian
control, an advisory role for the users, and settlement of disputes in
accordance with the UN Charter. The Indian proposal met with widespread
approval, including from Egypt. Later, when France and Britain got Israel to
attack Egypt and landed their troops in Suez, they were severely condemned by
even the US, and the UN and Nehru called it ‘naked aggression’ and a ‘reversion
to the past colonial methods’. The withdrawal took place under UN supervision
and Indian troops participated in large numbers in the peace-keeping force.
India continued to support Egyptian interests in subsequent negotiations
leading to the settlement even while trying to ensure that British and other
users’ interests were protected. In time, even Britain accepted the fairness of

that while the Soviets must withdraw, the situation was not as simple as made
out in the West. The existence of two zones of influence, West and East, in
Europe, was a fact of post-World War II life and any disturbance could set off
a domino effect. Nothing was to be gained by humiliating the Soviets through
formal condemnation, which in any case India refrained from doing as a matter
of policy, as it only hardened positions and made future compromise difficult.
Nehru himself criticized the Soviet action and did not send an ambassador to

abstaining when Kashmir next came up in the UN Security Council. Thereafter,

usability of power in international politics. The American leadership and

India chose based on planning and a leading role for the public sector in
industrialization, especially in heavy industry, brought her closer to the

steel plant in 1956. Then followed the British in Durgapur and the Germans in
Rourkela. The US was again approached for the Bokaro plant, but when it
continued to remain coy, the Soviets stepped in again. In later years they
played a critical role in oil exploration as well. In 1973-74, it was estimated

began to deteriorate from 1959 with the Dalai Lama seeking refuge in India and
military clashes on the Sino-Indian border, the USSR did not automatically side
with its Communist brother, but remained neutral, which itself was a great
achievement at that time. Nehru was well aware of the significance of the
Soviet stance, and he moved closer to USSR. The Chinese also date the beginning
of their differences with the Soviet Union to the same episode. In the same
year, India and the Soviet Union signed their first agreement for military
supplies and in 1960 India received ‘supply dropping aircraft, helicopters and
engineering equipment for the Border Roads Development Board which was to
construct roads in the areas disputed by China.’ In mid-1962, an agreement
permitting India to manufacture MiG aircraft was concluded, this being the
first time the Soviets had let a non-Communist country manufacture
sophisticated military equipment which even the Chinese had not been licensed
to do. The Chinese attack on India in October 1962 found the USSR again
maintaining neutrality, at least partly because it occurred when the Cuban
missile crisis was at its peak. Later, in December 1962, Suslov, the important
Soviet leader, at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet, unambiguously declared
that China was responsible for the war. </span></p>

deliver on promises of military supplies in the wake of the In-do-China war,
the Soviets in 1963 signed more agreements for sale of arms and supplied

missiles, submarines, missile boats and patrol ships. </span></p>

independent manufacturing base that helped India to win the 1971 war.
Importantly, unlike the US, they neither stationed personnel to supervise use
of equipment, nor laid down difficult conditions for deployment of equipment.
The Soviet Union too gained from this link. India was an important entry-point
to the Afro-Asian world of newly-independent countries who did not want to
become US satellites and were open to Soviet friendship. This helped the USSR
in the Cold War as well. The Soviets had, like India, a long border with China
and many unresolved boundary disputes. Friendship with India kept China in
check and this suited the Soviets. Indian non-alignment tilted the balance away
from the West and this too was a help. </span></p>

a patronizing attitude by the Soviets, something which the Americans often
tended to slip into; much to Indian annoyance. Indo-Soviet friendship thus

making both countries responsible for each other’s security. With Burma, too,
the problem of Indian settlers and a long uncharted border were settled
amicably. The issue of Tamil settlers in Sri Lanka was not as easy of solution,
and tensions remained, but it did not flare up in this period, and otherwise
amicable ties were maintained. With Pakistan, however, and in later years with

to the Partition of India as the solution to an intractable problem and also in
the hope that this would end the hostility. But, in fact, the acrimony was only
transferred to the international sphere. Communal riots and transfers of

but the Pakistani invasion of Kashmir in October 1947, just two months after
independence, unleashed a chain of cause and effect whose latest act was played
out only recently in Kargil. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Kashmir’s accession to India was a
troubled one. When the British left, most of the Indian states ruled indirectly
by the British but nominally by Indian princes joined up with either India or
Pakistan and the very real danger of Balkanization, almost encouraged by the
British, was averted. However, a few states, some of whose rulers, encouraged
by British officers and Pakistan, entertained grandiose but unreal ambitions of
independence, held out for some time. Among these were Hyderabad, Junagadh, and
Kashmir. Hyderabad and Junagadh had little real choice as they were surrounded
by Indian territory. But Kashmir had a border with Pakistan, a majority Muslim
population, a Hindu ruler, and a radical popular movement for democracy led by
Sheikh Abdullah and the National Conference which was very friendly with Nehru
and the Congress—enough potent ingredients for whipping up a recipe for
trouble. The Maharaja asked for a standstill agreement for one year to make up
his mind. Pakistan formally accepted his request and though India was yet to
reply its stand had always been that the people’s wishes should be ascertained
by an election and therefore it was quite willing to wait and accept the
verdict of the elections. However, clearly worried that the popular verdict in
Kashmir was not likely to go in its favour, Pakistan decided to jump the gun
and sent in so-called tribesmen from the Frontier province, aided by regular
armed forces, to invade Kashmir. The Maharaja appealed to India for help but
India could only send in her armies if Kashmir acceded to India. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>India pushed back the Pakistani
‘volunteers’, and also put in a complaint with the UN against Pakistani
aggression. There, instead of getting justice, India learnt her first lesson in
Cold War politics. Encouraged by the British who continued to nurture a
resentment of the Congress and India and a fondness for the Muslim League and
Pakistan, and also for strategic reasons of wanting Pakistan as a frontline
state against the USSR, the US also lined up behind Pakistan. The Soviet Union
had not yet made up its mind whether India was any longer ‘a running dog of
British imperialism’ and so it gave no support. Nevertheless, India dutifully
accepted the UN resolution asking for a ceasefire, even though the military
situation was to her advantage. Nehru was much criticized later for going to
the UN and for offering to hold a plebiscite. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>But neither criticism holds, as Pakistan
could have gone to the UN if India had not, and the UN could have asked for the
holding of a plebiscite. India has also been often misunderstood on its later
refusal to hold a plebiscite, because it is not widely known that the UN
resolution of August 1948 laid down two precondi-tions for holding a
plebiscite. One, that Pakistan should withdraw its forces from the state of
Jammu and Kashmir and two, that the authority of the Srinagar administration
should be restored over the whole state. These conditions were never met and in
the meantime Kashmir went on to hold elections for its Constituent Assembly,
which voted for accession to India. The Indian government now took the stand
that the Constituent Assembly’s vote was a sufficient substitute for
plebiscite. Kashmir later participated in the Indian general elections as well
as held its own state elections, thus rendering irrelevant the debate over
plebiscite. In any case, India had never accepted the two-nation theory that
all Muslims naturally owed allegiance to the Muslim League and all Muslim
majority areas belonged to Pakistan and on that basis Kashmir should go to
Pakistan—a Pakistani argument that often appealed to western observers
unfamiliar with the history of the Indian national movement. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>There was a brief period in 1953-54 when
it seemed the Kashmir issue may be resolved. On Mohammed Ali Bogra becoming
prime minister in 1953, following cordial visits between him and Nehru, a joint
communique was issued on 20 August 1953, stating that Nehru had agreed to hold
a plebiscite in Kashmir. But the brief flame of hope was snuffed out by the
exigencies of Cold War politics. The US had decided after Korea that Indian
non-alignment was immoral and it should give military aid to Pakistan. In the
UN Security Council, while India wanted as Plebiscite Administrator someone
from a small neighbouring country, the name that was proposed was of a senior
US Service Officer, Admiral Nimitz. The last chance of a compromise
disappeared. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Kashmir issue continued to be used to
needle India in the UN, especially as Pakistan became more and more integrated
into the US-fed western alliance system via membership of CENTO, SEATO, the
Baghdad Pact and a military pact with the US in 1954. India had clearly refused
to play the US game and Pakistan was more than willing. (Before independence
too the Muslim League had happily played the British game; its child, Pakistan,
now did US bidding. The Congress continued its anti-imperialist tradition.) In
this situation, to get a solution on Kashmir would need a miracle. Only when
the Soviet Union began to understand the value of Indian non-alignment and
openly supported India on Kashmir could India heave a sigh of relief. </span></p>

off the international pressure on the Kashmir issue through the mid-and late
fifties and early sixties. But the Chinese attack in 1962 which forced her to
turn to the West for help, made it very difficult for her to withstand US and
British pressure. From 1962 Pakistan also began to line up with the Chinese,
thus threatening to engulf India in a pincer movement, which almost came true
in 1971 but didn’t, to the great disappointment of the US. In the mid-sixties,
for a short while, the USSR also explored the possibility of moving a little
closer to Pakistan (the Tashkent initiative by Kosygin to end the Indo-Pak war
of 1965 was part of that) but fortunately for India, and not without Indian
encouragement, the USSR realized that Pakistan was too deeply integrated into
the western system to be of use to it. </span></p>

the two countries. Nehru tried his best to remove all other irritants in the
relationship, and showed great generosity on the division of pre-Partition
assets, compensation to refugees and division of Indus basin waters. He even
visited Pakistan in 1953. There is a little known story about a large sum of
money that India was to give Pakistan as part of the Partition settlement. When
Pakistan invaded Kashmir, the Indian government held up the transfer. Gandhiji
came to know of it and immediately had it sent to Pakistan, brushing aside the
objections of Nehru and Patel that they were only withholding it for the time
being so that it was not used for the purposes of war. At the same time,
Gandhiji fully supported the Indian armed defence of Kashmir. It is sometimes
said that Pakistani foreign policy is better than ours. It may help to remember
the comment of K.P.S. Menon: <span class=0Text>The net result of Pakistan’s

towards China from the very beginning. The Congress had been sympathetic to
China’s struggle against imperialism and had sent a medical mission to China in
the thirties as well as given a call for boycott of Japanese goods in protest
against Japanese occupation of China. India was the first to recognize the new
People’s Republic of China on 1 January 1950. Nehru had great hopes that the
two countries with their common experience of suffering at the hands of
colonial powers and common problems of poverty and underdevelopment would join
hands to give Asia its due place in the world. Nehru pressed for representation
for Communist China in the UN Security Council, did not support the US position
in the Korean War, and tried his best to bring about a settlement in Korea. In
1950, when China occupied Tibet, India was unhappy that it had not been taken
into confidence, but did not question China’s rights over Tibet since at many
times in Chinese history Tibet had been subjugated by China. In 1954, India and
China signed a treaty in which India recognized China’s rights over Tibet and
the two countries agreed to be governed in their mutual relations by the
principles of Panch Sheel. Differences over border delineation were discussed
at this time but China maintained that it had not yet studied the old
Kuomintang maps and these could be sorted out later. </span></p>

Conference. In 1959, however, there was a big revolt in Tibet and the Dalai
Lama fled Tibet along with thousands of refugees. He was given asylum in India
but not allowed to set up a government-in-exile and dissuaded from carrying on
political activities. Nevertheless, the Chinese were unhappy. Soon after, in
October 1959, Chinese opened fire on an Indian patrol near the Kongka Pass in
Ladakh, killing five Indian policemen and capturing a dozen others. Letters were
exchanged between the two governments, but a common ground did not emerge.
Then, Chou En-lai was invited for talks to Delhi in April 1960, but not much
headway could be made and it was decided to let officials sort out the details

was a great outcry in the country and a feeling of panic about Chinese
intentions. It was thought that the Chinese would come rushing in to the plains

1964 was most likely hastened by it. Worse, at the pinnacle of his outstanding
career, he had to face attacks from political opponents who would never have

willing to really underwrite massive aid in return for abandoning nonalignment.
The figures mentioned were in the range of $60-120 million, hardly princely

hold Nehru responsible for Chinese perfidy. One kind of argument sees him as a
naive fool who was blinded by sentiment and failed to guard Indian interests in
the face of an inevitable Communist betrayal. Another view, expounded most
notably by Neville Maxwell in <span class=1Text>India’s China War, </span><span

who, pushed by jingoist public pressure, refused to settle the borders with
China on the very reasonable terms offered by the Chinese and instead followed
from 1959 a ‘forward policy’ which provoked the Chinese to attack in
self-defence. Neither view does justice to the sophistication of Nehru’s
understanding of China and the subtlety of his policy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Nehru’s understanding of Chinese history,
of the history of revolutions, especially the Russian revolution, had convinced
him that China should not be isolated and pushed into a corner, but should be
brought into the community of nations and its revolution humanized. ‘We know
enough history to realize that a strong China is normally an expansionist
China,’ he said, but did not want to precipitate any conflict with China as it would
be as disastrous for both countries as was the French-German conflict. Before
the 1962 attack, on 7 December 1961, in the Lok Sabha he said, ‘a huge elephant
of a country sitting on our border is itself a fact that we could not ignore.’
He added that soon after the Chinese revolution he had come ‘to the conclusion
that our borders were going to be, well, threatened in some way.’ Nehru’s long
statement on 3 September 1963 in the Rajya Sabha explained at length about not
wanting to spend too much on the military, about the emphasis on building one’s
own strength as that is the only security. ‘No country that is not
industrialized is militarily strong today,’ and ‘the real thing before us was
to strengthen India industrially and not superficially, by getting an odd gun
or an odd aircraft.’ With Pakistan already hostile, India did not need another
neighbour as an enemy. Preparing for war on two fronts would have meant an end
to development. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

inevitable, should be delayed as much as possible by adopting a friendly
approach and asking others to do the same, for example by trying to get China
into the UN. He understood that the Chinese occupation of Tibet meant a common
border with attendant conflicts. But he also saw that China could not think of
expansionism as yet, as it had big problems to solve. After the revolt in
Tibet, and the Dalai Lama’s arrival, and the border clashes, he was well aware
of the dangers, but what good would it have done to threaten China? In an
effort to checkmate the Chinese he did make diplomatic preparations, by moving
closer to the Soviets. He had never bought the line that Communist China and
Communist USSR, would team up, and perhaps along with Indian Communists,
threaten the Indian state. He did not believe that China was a tool in the
hands of the Soviets, nor did he make the mistake of thinking that the Soviet
Union would back Communist brothers against Indian friends, as many in India
argued. </span></p>

attack, as he had thought at there may be occasional border skirmishes here and
there, but not an invasion of this nature. He erred in not anticipating the
precise nature of the attack, rather than in the foreign policy he pursued. A
further mistake was the panic in appealing to USA and UK for help, as next day
the Chinese withdrew. Irresponsible attacks on Nehru by sections of the Press,
the opposition parties, and even members of his own party had led to this
knee-jerk response. The failure of nerve on the battlefield was compounded by
that in the country at large with Nehru rather than the Chinese becoming the
butt of attack! Sadly, the country showed an inability to face adversity
stoically, with faith in its proven leaders, and instead fell into despair and
mutual recrimination. To his credit, Nehru tried his best to retrieve the
situation and get the country back to its bearings. </span></p>

India’s defeat at China’s hands in 1962 was not the result of Nehru’s naive
faith in Chinese friendship and Utopian pacifism and consequent neglect of
India’s defence preparedness. On the contrary, between 1949-50 and 1962, the
strength of the Indian Armed Forces doubled from 280,000 to 550,000 and that of
the Indian Air Force from seven combat squadrons in 1947 to nineteen by 1962.

of the possibilities of border clashes with the Chinese since 1959. But neither
the political nor the military leadership anticipated the precise nature of the
Chinese attack, and were therefore taken by surprise. Apparently, the military
leadership thought in terms of either border clashes or a full-scale war in the
plains of Assam, but not about the possibility of a limited deep thrust and
withdrawal. The Chief of Staff, General Thimayya, believed that a total war
with China was unthinkable because she would have full Soviet support. He and
other senior officers do not appear to have been aware of Sino-Soviet
differences. Nor does he seem to have conceived of a role for the Air Force ‘at
a time when the Indian Air Force could have swept the skies over Arunachal
Pradesh and Tibet without any opposition from the Chinese.’ (Nehru asked the US
for an air cover without consulting his own Air Force.) The failure was also,
it is felt, due to the lack of a proper system of higher defence command and
management, and because there was no system of defence planning and the
structure of civil-military relations was flawed. The chiefs of staff were not
integrated into the civilian policymaking structure, but remained theatre
commanders preparing for the near-term future but not for the long-term future
security environment. Despite Nehru’s warnings since 1959, of trouble with
China, much professional thought had not gone into the planning for a war in
the Himalayas. It was a failure of logistics, of intelligence, or rather of
analysis of intelligence, of coordination of different wings such as the Army
with the Air Force, etc. It was a failure of nerve on the part of the military
commander, who had an excellent record and had been decorated earlier, but
withdrew without a fight, though it is believed he could have held out for at
least seven days. The Chinese, on their part, withdrew as quickly as they came,
having achieved their objective of humiliating India by a quick but limited
thrust deep into Indian territory. Again, the Indian side had failed to
anticipate the Chinese withdrawal and had now begun planning to face a
full-scale war in the plains of Assam. </span></p>

is not treated seriously by most experts, as it is too obvious that India had

anyway? On the contrary, it can be shown that it was Chinese imperatives, of
which Maxwell shows no awareness that brought them to war, not Indian
provocation. And the factors that propelled China in the direction of conflict
were beyond Nehru’s control. </span></p>

insistence that Formosa (later Taiwan) was the only legitimate China, which

Soviets had repudiated the treaty that they had signed with China on
development of nuclear weapons. In the first week of August, 1962, the Soviets
signed an agreement with India on the manufacture of MiG-21 aircraft. They had
not done so with China. In the last week of August, the Soviets told the
Chinese that they were going ahead with negotiations for a Partial Test Ban
Treaty. The Chinese took this as being aimed at checking their efforts to
develop nuclear weapons. This was all the more galling to the Chinese because
they felt that Soviet Union was now in a position to use its weight to secure
Chinese interests in the international arena. </span></p>

Afro-Asian countries were following India’s line of seeking friendship and
assistance from both USSR and USA, rather than the Chinese line of keeping a
distance from both. By reducing India’s stature, they could hope to have their
line accepted. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Therefore, it is not at all unlikely that
the Chinese attack on India had little to do with issues between India and
China, but was a reaction to a feeling of isolation, abandonment and
frustration. By attacking India, they may have wanted to topple Nehru or at
least push India into the western camp so that the USSR could have no illusions
about Indian non-alignment and would have to rethink its policy of peaceful
coexistence, which, the Chinese figured, was leading to their isolation. They
failed on both counts. In fact, V. P. Dutt testifies that Deng Xiaoping said
later to an Indian delegation of which he was a member that it was Khrushchev
who was responsible for the 1962 war. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Thus, the causes of the 1962 attack were
related more to China’s own compulsions that to anything that Nehru or India
did or could have done. Not being able to get the recognition of the US, a UN
seat, leadership of Afro-Asia, Soviet support on the nuclear issue or the
border dispute with India, a leftward turn took place in Chinese politics. By
humiliating India, it wanted to show that her policy of peace and non-alignment
was not feasible. Nor was the Soviet policy of peaceful co-existence. India
would leave the policy of non-alignment under pressure and other countries of
Asia and Africa would follow the Chinese lead. Thus, the cause of the Indian
military humiliation could not be reduced to Indian foreign policy failure. It
could ‘only be characterized as one of those unforseeable random events of
history.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>If India’s policy towards China was a
failure, which other country’s was a success? The US did a complete volte-face
in 1971, and the USSR began changing, at least after 1959. The debacle of the
India-China war in no way raises doubts on the correctness of Nehru’s basic
thrust in foreign policy. For example, nonalignment ensured that even in the
India-China war, the US and the Soviet blocs were not ranged on opposite sides
and India succeeded in getting greater or lesser sympathy from both. This was
an unusual occurrence in the days of the Cold War. Secondly, Nehru had been
right in pursuing a policy of friendship with China, even if it ended the way
it did. Especially given the hostile relationship with Pakistan (which surfaced
soon after independence with the conflict over Kashmir and grew into a serious
threat when it was exacerbated by the US decision in 1954 to give military help
to Pakistan), it was in India’s interest to try its best to avoid having
another hostile neighbour and thus be caught in a pincer movement. India’s
espousal of China’s right to have a seat in the UN was not given up by Nehru
even after the Indo-China war since he rightly believed that the western
powers’ isolation of China only pushed her into becoming more irresponsible.
Besides, as Nehru was most fond of pointing out, defence was not just a matter
of weapons, it was also a function of economic development, of self-reliance;
otherwise defence was only skin-deep. A newly independent poor country like
India could have ill afforded to divert her scarce resources into building up a
massive military machine. On the contrary, by building up India’s economic
strength, Nehru enabled his successors to win impressive military victories. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The political foresight and pragmatism
that informed Nehru’s practice of nonalignment is testified to by the quick
course correction that has had to be undertaken every time attempts have been
made to move away from it. When Indira Gandhi became prime minister in 1966,
she felt that relations with the US and the West could be and needed to be
dramatically improved. This was because, on the one hand, US had a better idea
of Chinese militancy and had promised help if China attacked again, and on the
other, the grave food shortages caused by the drought and the critical economic
situation caused by the cumulative effect of the two wars in 1962 and 1965
necessitated such help. It was in pursuance of this line that Mrs. Gandhi
agreed to devalue the rupee on US advice though it is another matter that it
might have been in Indian interest to do so. She also visited the US in the
hope of receiving economic assistance, expediting food shipments and of
evolving a new relationship. She came back sadder and wiser and found that
President Lyndon Johnson, despite public posturing to the contrary,
deliberately delayed responding to urgent Indian requests for food and other
economic help. Indira Gandhi later said that one reason for this was to
pressur-ize India to stop criticism of US bombing of Vietnam. Indira Gandhi
was, however, quick to learn her lesson. </span></p>

strengthened ties with the Soviet Union, persuading it through a vigorous
diplomatic effort in 1966-67 to resist from a position of treating India and
Pakistan on the basis of parity and giving military assistance to Pakistan. The
Janata government when it came to power in 1977 talked loudly about practising
genuine non-alignment, but found soon that the earlier article had been genuine

policy; it was an approach, a framework, a method, not a straitjacket but a
lodestar by which the young nation could steer its course in the dark night.
Instead of imposing any rigidity in Indian foreign policy, non-alignment let it
evolve to meet the changing needs of Indian society. It did not come in the way
of the close relationship that developed with the USSR from 1954 onwards. Nor
did it come in the way of India joining the Commonwealth. In fact, Nehru’s
internationalist and humanitarian world-view did not lead to any sacrifice of
Indian interests or neglect of her defence needs, as is sometimes alleged. Nor
was Nehru a pacifist who refused to use force to defend Indian interests when
necessary. In 1947-48, he ordered the use of force in Kashmir (with Gandhiji’s
approval), Junagadh and Hyderabad, and in 1961 in Goa. The visionary nature of
Nehru’s understanding of international relations is shown by the fact that the
rest of the world has slowly come to adopt much of what was dismissed as naive
and imprac-tical when first articulated. Nuclear disarmament has become an
accepted and much-desired goal globally. </span></p>

The intention behind this was to bridge the gap between the elite class and the
common folk, in a bid to associate them towards constructive works in nation
building. The Nehru report supported the making of ‘Hindustani‘as the official
language of India, in a bid to give encouragement to provincial languages.
However, as English was used in all official correspondences by the leaders, it
couldn’t be gotten rid of. Moreover, little attention was paid to the details
of the vernacular language notion, in terms of how the choice of the national

went back to the pre-independence colonial rule where, in 1833, the Colebrook
Reforms brought several changes to the island’s socio-economic structure. These
reforms abolished the trade monopolies of the government, by paving the way for
a capitalistic system characterised by private enterprise. The introduction of
the Waste Land Ordinance in 1840 saw the occupation of large quantities of
unused land, and selling them to newly arriving classes of private planters and
entrepreneurs. The British then authorised the large-scale establishment of
commercial plantation leading to the arrival of South-Indian workers. </span></p>

Act of 1949 stripped the legal citizen statuses of the Indian workers. A series
of unsuccessful negotiations led Mrs. Bandarnaike to visit in India in 1964,

influenced the conflict and the changing scenes in the conflict influenced
their approach towards the parties involved. It would not be wrong to say that
India was fighting war at two fronts- one at the battlefield and other at the

development during the cold war period. After 1956 when Nikita Khrushchev

about Marxist ideology. By 1960, their criticism moved out in the open, when
Premier Khrushchev called Mao Zedong as “a nationalist, an adventurist, and a
deviationist” and Mao called Khrushchev as a Marxist revisionist, criticizing
him as “patriarchal, arbitrary and tyrannical”. By 1961, when the doctrinal differences

their attacks on the military positions on the Indian side and appealed for
observance of CFL. To India he appealed for restraint as regards retaliatory

Pakistan but received assurance from Indian side. This reflected that U Thant
was convinced that the trouble began because of the Pakistani action. On 4
September 1965, the Security Council, by resolution 209 (1965), called for a
ceasefire and asked the two Governments to cooperate fully with UNMOGIP in its
task of supervising the observance of the ceasefire. Two days later, the

continue to support it as it was a member of SEATO and CENTO. It had hoped that

China stayed out of the Indo –Pak conflict. However international pressure
besides General J.N.Choudhury’s wrong statement that India had exhausted

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>During the 1965 War, the Soviet Union had
offered its good offices for a peaceful settlement between the two warring
states. The Prime Ministers of India and President of Pakistan met at Tashkent
from January 4-10, 1966 and discussed the issues involved. Initially both sides
stuck to their demands. While Shastri desired assurance that all infiltrators
sent by Pakistan Army be withdrawn and there should be an assurance that such
operations would not be repeated and also pressed for a ‘no war pact’, Ayub
harped on the Kashmir issue to be discussed and demanded plebiscite in the
Kashmir. Kosygin stepped in and used all his diplomatic skills under his
command to convince them to come to an agreement. Both sides agreed to withdraw
forces to August 5 positions. Other items included that both sides would exert
all efforts to create good neighbourly relations in accordance with UN charter
and reaffirmation not to have recourse to force and to settle their disputes
through peaceful means. They also agreed not to encourage propaganda against
each other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>It is common to have an agreement after a
conflict to bring an armistice and if possible to resolve the issues connected
with the war. It was called a peace agreement ‘to restore normal and peaceful
relations between their countries and to promote understanding and friendly
relations between their peoples’. The main item was the withdrawal to the
August 5 positions and with that India had to return the Haji pir and other
areas. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The items included in the Tashkent
Agreement were very valuable and if they were implemented in letter and spirit,
they could usher a new era of peace and friendship. The question remains why
Shastri agreed to return strategic areas which had been occupied by the Indian
Army. While the actual answer cannot be obtained as Shastri died within hours
of signing the agreement, only some guess can be made. Shastri may have been
persuaded to accept it with the assurance that Pakistan would not use force in
future (which was accepted in the agreement). He may have been motivated to
accept this to have enduring peace and goodwill with the neighbour particularly
when Soviet Union had given the assurance that Pakistan would not use force.
Ayub is reported to have stated that Pakistan would not be use force in future.
How India was misled was clear soon. Bhutto stated that ‘the UN charter does
not prevent a state to use force in self-defence. Ayub also stated that the
Tashkent Agreement did not change Pak attitude towards Kashmir. This reflects
that the Indian leadership failed to read the real intentions of Pak leadership
and missed an opportunity to keep Pakistan under pressure till the resolution
of the all the issues. </span></p>

nothing more than this. But the war proved important in many respects. First,
this was the first successful operation that not only thwarted Pak attempt to

considerable pressure on Pakistan. Pakistan failed in its gamble to change the
situation in J&amp;K. Second, war improved India’s prestige internationally
particularly after the Sino-Indian War of 1962. The Times in its editorial
reported that India was going to be Asia’s power. Third, it significantly
improved relations with Soviet Union and paid dividend during 1971 War. </span></p>

issue of succession to the fore. This, the second succession in two years, was
again smoothly accomplished, and affirmed the resilience of India’s political
system. Morarji Desai was once again in the field. Kamaraj’s and the
Syndicate’s dislike for Desai had not lessened, and they looked around for a
candidate who could defeat Desai but remain under their shadow. Their choice
fell on Indira Gandhi: she was Nehru’s daughter, had an all-India appeal and a
progressive image, and was not identified with any state, region, caste or
religion. They also thought that Indira Gandhi, being inexperienced and a young
woman and lacking substantial roots in the party, would be more pliable and
malleable. </span></p>

the Congress parliamentary party was held on 19 </span></p>

Desai by 355 votes to 169. Her being a woman had been no handicap, for women
had participated actively in the freedom struggle with thousands of them going
to jail and several of them had held high positions in Congress, including its
presidentship. After independence, too, they had occupied high offices, of
governors and cabinet ministers at the Centre and in the states, including that
of the chief minister of U.P., India’s largest state. Indira Gandhi’s
government was faced with several grave problems which were long in the making
but which required immediate attention and solutions. Punjab was on the boil
and the Naga and Mizo areas were in rebellion. She dealt effectively with these
problems by accepting the demand for Punjabi Suba and being firm with the Naga
and Mizo rebels, showing willingness to negotiate with them and accepting the
Naga rebels’ demand for autonomy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>It was, however, the economic situation
which was intractable. The economy was in recession and fast deteriorating.
Industrial production and exports were declining. The rains failed for the
second successive year in 1966, and the drought was more severe than in 1965,
and led to galloping inflation and grave food shortages. Famine conditions
prevailed in large parts of the country, especially in Bihar and eastern U.P. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The wars of 1962 and 1965 and the
Pakistan-China axis had led to a sharp rise in military expenditure and
diversion of resources from planning and economic development. Budget deficits
were growing, endangering the Fourth Five Year Plan. The situation required
hard decisions and their firm enforcement, but the government vacillated, was
slow in taking decisions and, what was even worse, tardy and ineffective in
implementing them. In particular, it could not reduce its own bloated
administrative expenditure which the financial situation required. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The government however, succeeded
remarkably in dealing with the drought and famine situation. The problems of
procurement and distribution of foodgrains and prevention of famine deaths were
handled on a war-footing. There were very few famine deaths as compared to the
record of millions dying in the colonial period from comparative or even lesser
intensity droughts and famines. This was a major achievement for Indian
democracy. The one decisive step taken by the government to deal with the
deteriorating economic situation and to bolster food imports boomeranged and
proved to be the most controversial of Mrs. Gandhi’s early decisions. As
already mentioned, Indian exports were not growing and even the existing ones
were being heavily subsidized by the central exchequer. Indira Gandhi’s
advisers argued that this was due to the rupee being grossly over-valued. If it
were devalued, there would be a greater inflow of the much-needed foreign
capital. India was heavily dependent for its food security on imports of wheat
from the US under the PL-480 aid programme. Also there was an urgent need for
economic aid by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
stopped during the Indo-Pak war, to be resumed. The US, the World Bank and the
IMF however, insisted on devaluation of the rupee. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Consequently, the Government of India
devalued the rupee by 35.5 per cent on 6 June, barely four months after Mrs.
Gandhi assumed power. There were angry country-wide outbursts against the
decision. All sections of political opinion opposed the step, the most voluble
critics being the left groups and parties, the majority of intellectuals and
Kamaraj, who also resented the fact that he was not consulted before the
decision was taken. The critics within the Congress party also felt that such a
controversial and unpopular decision should not have been taken in an election
year. There was also the widespread resentment against the government for
acting under foreign pressure. The devaluation, ironically, failed in its
stated objectives of increasing exports and attracting foreign capital. Nor was
there a significant increase in the flow of food and other foreign aid. Many
years later, in 1980, Mrs. Gandhi was to confess that the devaluation ‘was the
wrong thing to do and it harmed us greatly.’ A few months after coming to power,
Mrs. Gandhi took major initiatives in the field of foreign affairs. Urgently
needing American wheat, financial aid and capital investment, she initially
tried to build bridges with the United States, especially during her visit to
Washington in March 1966. President Johnson promised to send 3.5 million tons
of foodgrains to India under PL-480 </span></p>

actual despatches to India were irregular and came in small install-ments.
Moreover, the President took charge of the dispatches in order to control their
amount and timing on a ‘ton by ton’ basis and thus to ensure that ‘India
changed its farm policy’ as also its position on Vietnam. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Indira Gandhi felt humiliated by this
‘ship-to-mouth’ approach by the United States, and refused to bow before such
ham-handed and open pressure. She also decided to get out of this vulnerable
position as soon as possible. In fact, India was never again to try to come
close to the US on onerous terms. Indira Gandhi’s disappointment with the US
found expression in the sphere of foreign policy. She started distancing
herself from that country. During her visit to Washington, in March-April 1966
she had remained silent on Vietnam. Now, in July 1966, she issued a statement
deploring US bombing of North Vietnam and its capital Hanoi. In the latter part
of July, in Moscow, she signed a joint statement with the Soviet Union
demanding an immediate and unconditional end to the US bombing and branding US
action in Vietnam as ‘imperialist aggression’. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In Washington, Mrs. Gandhi had agreed to
the US proposal for an Indo-American Educational Foundation to be funded by
PL-480 rupee funds to the extent of 300 million dollars. She now abandoned the
proposal, partially because it had been vehemently criticized by a large number
of Indian intellectuals and those of leftist opinion, both inside and outside
Congress, as an American effort to penetrate and control higher education and
research in India. Mrs. Gandhi developed close links with Nasser of Egypt and
Tito of Yugoslavia and began to stress the need for non-aligned countries to
cooperate politically and economically in order to counter the danger of
neocolonialism emanating from the US and West European countries. Worried by
the Soviet efforts to build bridges with Pakistan and to occupy a position of
equidistance from both India and Pakistan, Mrs. Gandhi assured the Soviet
leaders of India’s continuing friendship. She also expressed a desire to open a
dialogue with China but there was no thaw in Sino-Indian relations at the time.
In general, after the Washington fiasco, she followed a policy of sturdy
independence in foreign affairs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The 1966 was one of continuous popular
turmoil, of mass economic discontent and political agitations provoked by
spiralling prices, food scarcity, growing unemployment, and, in general,
deteriorating economic conditions. Adding to this unrest were the rising and
often unfulfilled aspirations of different sections of society, especially the
lower middle classes. Many were able to satisfy them but many more were not.
Moreover, the capitalist pattern of development was increasing economic
disparity between different social classes, strata and groups. A wave of
popular agitations—demonstrations, student strikes and riots, agitations by
government servants—commenced at about the same time Mrs. Gandhi was being
sworn in as prime minister. These agitations often turned violent. A new
feature was the bandhs which meant closure of a town, city, or entire state.
Law and order often broke down as the agitating crowds clashed with
lathi-wielding police. Sometimes the army had to be called in. Lathicharges and
police firings brought the administration into further disrepute. Teachers and
other middle class professionals such as doctors and engineers also now began
to join the ranks of strikers and agitators demanding higher pay and dearness
allowances to offset the sharp rise in prices. There was growing loss of public
confidence in the administration and the ruling political leadership. Opposition
political parties, especially, CPM, Socialists and Jan Sangh, took full
advantage of the popular mood to continually embarrass the government and took
the lead in organizing bandhs and other agitations. Some of them believed that
administrative breakdown would create conditions for them to come to power
through elections or through non-parliamentary, extra-constitutional means.
Consequently, they often did not observe democratic boundaries or
constitutional proprieties. </span></p>

beginning of the downslide of the parliament as an institution. There were
constant disturbances and indiscipline in the parliament with some members of

keeping with her office. She was often subjected to heckling and harassment,
vicious and vulgar personal attacks, male chauvinist and sexist references and
unfounded allegations. Dr Rammanohar Lohia, in particular, missed no

this because of 1967 being an election year. Also, as a political leader, she
suffered at this time from two major weaknesses: she was ineffective as a

the first introduction of High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds in Indian
agriculture. This was coupled with better and efficient irrigation and the
correct use of fertilizers to boost the crop. The end result of the Green
Revolution was to make India self-sufficient when it came to food grains. After
1947 India had to rebuild its economy. Over three-quarters of the population
depended on agriculture in some way. But agriculture in India was faced with
several problems. Firstly, the productivity of grains was very low. And India
was still monsoon dependent because of lack of irrigation and other
infrastructure. There was also an absence of modern technology. And India had
previously faced severe famines during the British Raj, who had only promoted
cash crops instead of food crops. The idea was to never depend on any other
country for food sufficiency. So in 1965, the government with the help of
Indian geneticists M.S. Swaminathan, known as the father of Green Revolution,
launched the Green Revolution. </span></p>

fertility, erosion of soil, soil toxicity, diminishing water resources,
pollution of underground water, salinity of underground water, increased incidence
of human and livestock diseases and global warming are some of the negative
impacts of over adoption of agricultural technologies by the farmers to make
the Green Revolution successful. Indiscriminate and disproportionate use of
chemicals pollutes the soil, air and water and feed and fodders offered to
animals. This may be one of the important etiologies of increased productive
and reproductive health problems of livestock. Various scientific studies and
surveys conducted on fertilizer and pesticide residues during last 45 years
indicate the presence of residues of fertilizers and pesticides like nitrates,
organochlorines, organophosphates, syn-thetic pyrethroids and carbamates at
higher level than permissible limit in milk, dairy products, water, fodder,
livestock feeds and other food products. As urea, a nitrogen-rich fertilizer is
used much more than the recommended 4-to-1 ratio to potassium; it is
contributing to the global warming. The extent of systematic damages caused in
the process of Green Revolution to the soil, groundwater, and ecosystem needs
to be quantified. It could lead to irreversible consequences for the people who

Center (BARC) on 7 September 1972 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave verbal
authorization to the scientists there to manufacture the nuclear device they
had designed and prepare it for a test. Following this okay, the practical work
of engineering to implement the paper design began. Work also began on
locating, surveying, and preparing a suitable test site. Throughout the
development of this device, more formally dubbed the “Peaceful Nuclear

kind were kept either on the development process or the decision making
involved in its development and testing. This was intentional to help preserve

the superpowers using nuclear explosive technology for developmental and industrial
applications like civil engineering projects, deep sea mining and so on.
However, during the negotiations for a treaty on the non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons (NPT) at the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee (ENDC) in
the mid-1960s, the Americans refused to accept PNE as an integral part of the
civilian nuclear energy applications or as a peaceful nuclear energy resource,
arguing that the dividing line between a PNE device and a nuclear weapon is
thin. The Americans, instead, offered to give PNE technology on a commercial
basis, which India rejected terming the offer as an ‘atomic apartheid’</span></p>

security guarantees and the imbalanced nature of the NPT text, the apparent
discrimination over PNE rights was also among the key reasons for India’s
decision to reject the NPT in 1968. Four years after the NPT entered into force
in 1970, India went on to undertake the nuclear test which was described by the
Indian Government as a PNE, though many Western nations saw it as a
demonstration of India’s capability to develop nuclear weapons. Another

urban poverty or economic inequality, nor was there any lessening of caste and
class oppression in the countryside. The immediate provocation for the rising
discontent was the marked deterioration in the economic situation. A
combination of recession, growing unemployment, rampant inflation and scarcity
of foodstuffs created a serious crisis. The burden of feeding and sheltering
nearly 10 million refugees from Bangladesh during 1971 had depleted the grain
reserves and, combined with the cost of the Bangladesh war, had led to a large
budgetary deficit. The war had also drained foreign exchange reserves. Monsoon
rains failed for two years in succession during 1972 and 1973, leading to a
terrible drought in most parts of the country and a massive shortage of
foodgrains, and fuelling their prices. </span></p>

crude oil increased four-fold, leading to massive increase in the prices of
petroleum products and fertilisers. This drained foreign reserves, further
increased the budgetary deficit and deepened economic recession. With all this,
prices rose continuously, by 22 per cent in 1972-73 alone. The price rise,
which affected both the poor and the middle classes, was accompanied by
scarcity of essential articles of consumption. There were food riots in several
parts of the country. </span></p>

strikes in different parts of the country during 1972 and 1973, culminating in
an all-India railway strike in May 1974. The railway strike lasted twenty-two
days but was broken in the end. Mrs. Gandhi’s popularity among the workers was
eroded further. Law and order deteriorated, particularly during 1974-75.
Strikes, student protests and popular demonstrations often turned violent. Many
colleges and universities were closed for prolonged periods. In May 1973, there
was a mutiny in U.P. by the Provincial Armed Constabulary, which clashed with
the army sent to discipline it, leading to the death of over thirty-five
constables and soldiers. </span></p>

political and law and order situation firm and clear leadership was needed, as
exhibited during the Bangladesh crisis and in the handling of foreign affairs.
But that was not forthcoming. The political situation was worsened by the play
of other factors. Congress had been declining as an organization and proved
incapable of dealing with the political crisis at the state and grassroots
levels. The government’s capacity to redress the situation was seriously
impaired by the growing corruption in most areas of life and the widespread
belief that the higher levels of the ruling party and administrators were
involved in it. The whiff of corruption touched even Indira Gandhi when her
inexperienced younger son, Sanjay Gandhi, was given a licence to manufacture
50,000 Maruti cars a year. A major new development was the growing detachment
of three major social groups from Congress. While the poor continued to support
it, though more passively, the middle classes, because of price rise and the stink
of corruption, the rich peasantry, because of the threat of land reform, and
the capitalists, because of the talk of socialism, nationalization of banks and
coal mining and anti-monopoly measures, turned against Congress and Indira
Gandhi. Desperation of the opposition parties also contributed to the
undermining of the political system. </span></p>

In order to better the situation, despite his old age, he embarked on the task

Swarajya and establishing people’s government. Explaining the term ‘peoples

by cutting across their individual and party interests. His motive behind
charging up the Bihar students was to bring about a complete change in the
entire governmental structure and the system of Indian polity. It is for this
reason he called it a Total Revolution. JP presented the concept of total

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In his prison dairy, JP once stated that
Total Revolution is a combination of seven revolu tions, viz., political,
social, economic, cultural, ideological or intellectual, educational and
spiritual; and the main motive being to bring in a change in the existing
society that is in tune with the ideals of the Sarvodaya. JP had a very
idealistic notion of soci ety and it is in this endeavor, he shifted from
Marxism to Socialism and later towards Sarvodaya. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Like Gandhi, he also experimented with
his own beliefs, tested his notions and modified his ideas. The inherent
contradictions within the Parliamentary democ racy made JP lose any faith he
had in it. He opined that democracy gives no assurance for a better life to the
people in the future when they are socially and economically neglected. He
opined that only a peaceful revolution could bring about some change in the
society. One of the main reasons for lack of development in India, according to
JP, was the widespread corruption in all walks of life. He believed that the
multiparty system and general elections every five years had reared corruption.
Further, the failure of economic planning and public investments is also due to
this corruption. Through this revolution, JP aimed at changing the society and
also the individuals’ outlook towards the society. He also asked the workers in
Bihar to prepare for the long struggle for achieving the objectives of total
revolution. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>He laid out a plan for the movement; on
how the revolution should move on the propaganda for public education, and
constructive programmes consisting of creating consciousness about various
social evils such as dowry system, caste conflicts, communalism and
untouchability. Thus, JP had a very clear perspective of the social ideals and
objectives when he took upon the task of guiding the Indian masses for a
concrete action. JP strongly believed that for democracy to be a lively and
effective instrument there is an urgent need for a strong opposition, powerful
public opinion, free and fear less press, ideological and moral pressure from
the academicians, and trade unions. He, in fact, advised the people to revise
their thinking and attitude towards democratic functioning in India. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Bihar movement was, however,
characterised by two new features. Jayaprakash Narayan, popularly known as JP,
came out from political retirement, took over its leadership, and gave a call
for ‘Total Revolution’ or ‘a struggle against the very system which has
compelled almost everybody to go corrupt.’ Demanding resignation of the
Congress government in Bihar and dissolution of the assembly, he asked the
students and the people to put pressure on the existing legislators to resign, paralyze
the government, gherao the state assembly and government offices, set up
parallel people’s governments all over the state, and pay no taxes. The second
feature was the firm refusal of Indira Gandhi to concede the demand for the
dissolution of the assembly, lest it spread to cover other parts of the country
and the central government. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>JP also decided to go beyond Bihar and
organize a country-wide movement against widespread corruption and for the
removal of Congress and Indira Gandhi, who was now seen as a threat to
democracy and portrayed as the fountainhead of corruption. JP now repeatedly
toured the entire country and drew large crowds especially in Delhi and other
parts of North India which were Jan Sangh or Socialist strongholds. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The JP Movement attracted wide support
especially from students, middle classes, traders and a section of the
intelligentsia. It also got the backing of nearly all the non-left political
parties who had been trounced in 1971 and who saw in JP a popular leader who
would enable them to acquire credibility as an alternative to Congress. JP in
turn realized that without the organizational structures of these parties he
could not hope to face Indira Gandhi either in the streets or at the polls. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The fervor of the JP Movement, however,
did not last long and it began to decline by the end of 1974. Most of his
student followers went back to their classes. Moreover, the movement had failed
to attract the rural and urban poor even in Gujarat and Bihar. Denouncing the
JP Movement for its extra-parliamentary approach, Indira Gandhi challenged JP
to test their respective popularity in Bihar as also the country as a whole in
the coming general elections, due in February-March 1976. JP accepted the
challenge and his supporting parties decided to form a National Coordination
Committee for the purpose. </span></p>

JP was hopeful that there would be a change in socio-political and economic

issue as to who actually represented the Indian people would be resolved through
the democratic electoral process. However, this was not to be. A sudden twist
to Indian politics was given by a judgement on 12 June 1975 by Justice Sinha of
the Allahabad High Court, on an election petition by Raj Narain, convicting
Mrs. Gandhi for having indulged in corrupt campaign practices and declaring her
election invalid. The conviction also meant that she could not seek election to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

another political blow when the Gujarat assembly election results came on 13
June. The opposition Janata front won 87 seats and the Congress 75 seats in a
house of 182. Surprisingly, the Janata front succeeded in forming a government
in alliance with the same Chimanbhai Patel against whose corruption and
maladministration the popular movement had been initiated. The Allahabad
judgement and the Gujarat assembly results revived the opposition movement. JP
and the coalition of opposition parties were, however, not willing to wait for
the result of Indira Gandhi’s appeal to the Supreme Court or the general
elections to the Lok Sabha due in eight months. They decided to seize the
opportunity and, accusing Mrs. Gandhi of ‘clinging to an office corruptly
gained,’ demanded her resignation and called for a country-wide campaign to
force the issue. In a rally in Delhi on 25 June they announced that a nation-wide
one-week campaign of mass mobilization and civil disobedience to force Mrs.
Gandhi to resign would be initiated on 29 June. The campaign would end with the
gherao of the prime minister’s house by hundreds of thousands of volunteers. In
his speech at the rally, JP asked the people to make it impossible for the
government to function and once again appealed to the armed forces, the police
and the bureaucracy to refuse to obey any orders they regarded as ‘illegal’ and
‘unconstitutional’. Mrs. Gandhi’s lightening response was to declare a state of
Internal Emergency on 26 June. </span></p>

Ali Ahmed proclaimed national emergency across India in 1975, which lasted for
21 months. Thus, elections were suspended and civil liberties curbed. Most of
Gandhi’s political opponents were imprisoned and the press was censored. The
Emergency also saw the violation of a sundry of human rights. The period saw
the shambolic forced mass-sterilization campaign spearheaded by Sanjay Gandhi.
Therefore, the emergency period is considered one of the most controversial
times in independent India’s history. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

reacted to the Emergency with marked hostility, the large majority of the
people initially responded to it with passivity, acquiescence, acceptance or
even support. It was only from the beginning of 1976 that the Emergency started
becoming unpopular. Why was this delayed reaction? For one, the people had no
experience in recent memory that is since independence, of an authoritarian
rule. There was bewilderment as also personal fear of the unknown. Moreover,
apart from the arrest of opposition leaders, the repressive measures were
almost entirely directed either against anti-social elements or against the
extreme right or the miniscule far left, who had enjoyed little popular support
before the Emergency. </span></p>

first few days in the entire country was less than 10,000. But many of the
detenus were released within a short span of time. Above all, a large number of
people were impressed by the positive outcome of some of the well-publicized
Emergency measures most of which could, of course, have been taken without an
Emergency. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>With the restoration of public order and
discipline, many felt relieved that the country had been saved from disorder
and chaos. There was less crime in the cities; gheraos and uncontrolled, often
violent, demonstrations came to an end; there was a perceptible lessening of
tension in the air; there was calm and tranquility on the campuses as students
and teachers went back to class rooms. Inder Malhotra, a perceptive journalist,
was to write later: ‘The return of normal and orderly life, after relentless
disruption by strikes, protest marches, sit-ins and clashes with the police,
was applauded by most people … In its initial months at least, the Emergency
restored to India a kind of calm it had not known for years There was also an
immediate and general improvement in administration, with government servants
coming to office on time and being more considerate to the public. Quick,
dramatic and well-publicized action was taken against smugglers, hoarders,
blackmarketeers, illegal traders in foreign currency and tax evaders, with
several thousand of them put behind bars under the MISA. There was a major,
dramatic improvement in the economy, though only some of it was really due to
steps taken under the Emergency; some of it being the result of excellent rains
and some of the policies initiated much before the Emergency. Most welcome was
the dramatic improvement in the price situation. Prices of essential goods,
including foodstuffs, came down and their availability in shops improved. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Popular hopes were raised and the
Emergency made more palatable by the announcement on 1 July of the omnibus
Twenty-Point Programme by Mrs. Gandhi, its edge being the socio-economic uplift
of the vast mass of the rural poor. The Programme promised to liquidate the
existing debt of landless labourers, small farmers and rural artisans and
extend alternate credit to them, abolish bonded labour, implement the existing
agricultural land ceiling laws and distribute surplus land to the landless,
provide house sites to landless labourers and weaker sections, revise upwards
minimum wages of agricultural labour, provide special help to handloom
industry, bring down prices, prevent tax evasion and smuggling, increase
production, streamline distribution of essential commodities, increase the
limit of income-tax exemption to Rs 8,000, and liberalize investment
procedures. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Serious efforts were made to implement
the Twenty-Point Programme; and some quick results were produced in terms of
reduction of prices, free availability of essential commodities, and check on
hoarding, smuggling and tax evasion. But the heart of the Twenty-Point
Programme was its agenda of the uplift of the rural poor. Some progress was made
even there. Three million house sites were provided to the landless and the
Dalits. About 1.1 million acres of surplus land was distributed to the
landless; this was, however, less than 10 per cent of the surplus land. Bonded
labour was made illegal but little dent was made in the practice. Laws were
passed in different states placing a moratorium on the recovery of debts from
the landless labourers and small farmers and in some cases to scale-down or
liquidate their debts. But the scale of the alternate credit provided through
nationalized banks and rural cooperative institutions was small and dependence
on the usurious moneylenders, who were often also the big landowners, remained.
Minimum wages for agricultural labourers were enhanced but their enforcement
was again tardy. On the whole, however, the rural segment of the Twenty-Point
Programme ran out of steam as its progress was hindered by large landowners and
rich peasants and an unsympathetic bureaucracy. Consequently, though the
programme brought some relief to the rural poor, there was little improvement
in their basic condition. A major factor in the people’s acceptance of the
Emergency was its constitutional, legal and temporary character. </span></p>

Emergency-</span></span><span lang=EN>Within a few months, however, the people
started getting disillusioned with the Emergency. Popular discontent from
mid-1976 reached its zenith six months later. The reasons for this are varied.
Relief to the people did not last long. Economic growth of the first year of
the Emergency was not sustained. Agricultural output declined; prices rose by
10 per cent by the end of 1976. The corrupt, black-marketeers and smugglers
resumed their activities as the shock of the Emergency wore off. The poor were
disenchanted with the slow progress in their welfare and workers were unhappy
because of limits on wages, bonus and dearness allowance and restrictions on
the right to strike. The government servants and teachers became discontented
because they were being disciplined in their work places and in many cases were
being forced to fulfil sterilization quotas. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In fact, no real progress along the
proclaimed lines was possible, for Mrs. Gandhi and Congress failed to create
any new agencies of social change or organs for popular mobilization. Reliance
for the implementation of the Twenty-Point Programme and other developmental
programmes was placed exclusively on the same old corrupt and inefficient
bureaucracy and manipulative and discredited politicians. So far as the common
people were concerned, matters took a turn for the worse, for there were no
avenues of protest or any other mechanism for the voicing and redressal of
their grievances. Even common people and not merely intellectuals and political
workers lived in an atmosphere of fear and insecurity. The bureaucracy and the
police now got increased power that was unchecked by criticism and exposure
from the Press, courts, MLAs and MPs, political parties and popular movements.
The two set out to abuse this power in usual forms. This affected all but
eventually the poor were the most affected. This was particularly true in
northern India. </span></p>

censorship and the silencing of protest led to the government being kept in

began to generate the fear that the authoritarian structure of the rule might
be made permanent or continue for a long time, particularly as Mrs. Gandhi had
got parliament to postpone elections by one year in November 1976. The
intelligentsia—teachers, journalists, professionals, and small town lawyers—and
middle classes in particular viewed the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution,
passed in September 1976, as an effort to subvert democracy by changing the
very basic structure of the Constitution. The Emergency, earlier acceptable,
began to lose legitimacy. </span></p>

of the Emergency regime was, however, the development of an
extra-constitutional centre of power associated with the rise to political
power of Mrs. Gandhi’s younger son, Sanjay Gandhi, who held no office in the
government or Congress. By April 1976, Sanjay Gandhi emerged as a parallel
authority, interfering at will in the working of the government and
administration. He was courted and obeyed by Cabinet ministers, Congress
leaders, chief ministers and senior civil servants. </span></p>

points which gradually became more important than the official twenty points.
The four points were: don’t take dowry at the time of marriage; practise family
planning and limit families to only two children; plant trees; and promote
literacy. Sanjay Gandhi was also determined to beautify the cities by clearing
slums and unauthorized structures impeding roads, bazaars, parks, monu-ments,
etc. Pushed by Sanjay Gandhi, the government decided to promote family planning
more vigorously and even in an arbitrary, illegitimate and authoritarian
manner. Incentives and persuasion were increasingly replaced by compulsion and coercion
and above all by compulsory sterilization. Government servants, school teachers
and health workers were assigned arbitrarily fixed quotas of number of persons
they had to ‘motivate’ to undergo sterilization. The police and administration
added their might to the enforcement of the quotas. The most affected were the
rural and urban poor who often protested in all sorts of everyday ways,
including recourse to flight, hiding and rioting. Moreover, in view of press
censorship, stories, true and false, of forcible vasectomies and violent
resistance by the people spread quickly and widely. </span></p>

then hold open and free elections? After all she had got parliament to postpone
elections by one year only two months before in November 1976. There is up to
now no satisfactory answer to the question, though there has been a great deal
of speculation. Three broad explanations are offered. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Firstly, the favourable view is that the
decision was an expression of Mrs. Gandhi’s underlying commitment to liberal
democracy and democratic values. Mary C. Carras, her biographer, has argued
that, ‘Throughout her life her self-image had been that of a democrat; indeed
her self-respect derives in good part from this self-image … She was compelled
to prove to the world and, above all, to herself, that she is and always has
been a democrat.’ In the opinion of some other writers once Mrs. Gandhi became
aware of the Emergency excesses and realized that the matters were getting out
of her control, she decided to get out of this trap by holding elections even if
it meant losing power. </span></p>

<p class=Para1 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>108</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The unfriendly view is that Mrs. Gandhi
completely misread the popular temper and, misinformed by sy-cophants and
intelligence agencies, was convinced that she would win. Isolated from public
opinion, she was unaware of the extent to which her rule had become unpopular.
By winning the election she hoped to vindicate the Emergency and also clear the
way for Sanjay Gandhi to succeed her. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The third view is that she realized that
the policies of the Emergency had to be legitimized further through elections.
The imposition of the Emergency had been legitimized at the outset by the
constitutional provision, but that was not enough in view of the deep-seated
traditions of Indian people. Moreover, there were clear signs of restiveness
and even discontent among the people. The Emergency regime, she must have
realized, was increasingly getting discredited and was quite fragile. Either
the authoritarian content of the Emergency would have to be deepened, with
recourse to increasing ruthlessness and brutality in suppress-ing dissent, or
greater legitimacy and political authority acquired by changing back to a
democratic system. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The former option would not work in a
country of India’s size and diversity and also in view of its democratic
traditions. The people would not accept the level of repression that it would
require. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>During 1975-77, many Indians and India’s
friends abroad had doubts about the future of the democratic system in India,
though they hoped that it would survive the political crisis. The less
sympathetic said that democracy in India was ‘permanently in eclipse’ and that
India had finally joined the ranks of other post-colonial societies as an
authoritarian state. Many others said that the basic changes initiated by the
Emergency and the essential features of the new kind of regime would continue
even if the Emergency were ended and the parliamentary system restored. Some
commentators went further and argued that the shift towards authoritarianism
had been going on since 1950 and was inherent in a poor and illiterate society.
Others held that the democratic constitutional system established in India in
1950 was not suited to the genius of India or the needs of its people. Still
others felt that it was not possible to combine economic development with
democracy. Many radicals argued that, in any case, liberal democracy was only a
facade hiding the underlying brutal reality of class domination and the
suppression of people’s struggles. The Emergency had, therefore, only removed
the facade; it did not mean any basic political change except that the social
and political reality was now visible to all. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>There were, of course, many in India and
abroad who were convinced that the Emergency was a temporary departure from the
basic commitment of Indian people and its political leadership to democracy and
that democracy would be sooner or later restored in the country. The democratic
system in India not only survived the JP Movement and the Emergency but emerged
stronger. Since 1977, all talk of the need for dictatorship to develop
economically and to end corruption has died down. Those who hold this view have
been reduced to a tiny minority and that too among the middle classes; no
intellectual or political leader of any stature has espoused it for several
years. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In this sense, the lifting of the
Emergency and the free elections that followed, were a defining moment in
India’s post-independence history. They revealed the Indian people’s underlying
attachment to democratic values which were in turn the result of the impact of
the freedom struggle and the experience of democratic functioning, including
free elections, since 1947. As Tariq Ali pointed out, in the elections of March
1977 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘the urban and rural poor demonstrated in
a very concrete and striking fashion that questions of basic civil rights were
not merely the preoccupations of the urban middle classes.’ Inder Malhotra,
covering the election campaign, reported of the ‘truly remarkable’ manner in
which ‘village audiences in the remote countryside react to sophisticated
arguments about civil liberties, fundamental rights and independence of the
judiciary.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Whatever the character of the JP Movement
or of the Emergency regime, there is no doubt that the decision of Mrs. Gandhi
to hold genuinely free elections, and her defeat and the Opposition’s victory
that followed were a remarkable achievement of Indian democracy. The years
1975-77 have been described as the years of the ‘test of democracy’; there is
no doubt that the Indian people passed the test with distinction if not full
marks. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

in January 1977, the opposition leaders announced the merger of Congress (O),
Jan Sangh, Bharatiya Lok Dal (BLD) and Socialist Party into the new Janata
Party. The Congress was dealt a blow by the sudden defection from it on 2
February 1977 of Jagjivan Ram, H.N. Bahuguna and Nandini Satpathy who formed
the Congress for Democracy (CFD). Along with DMK, Akali Dal and CPM </span></p>

Party in order to give a straight fight to Congress and its allies, the CPI and
AIADMK in the March elections to the Lok Sabha. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The opposition front made the Emergency
and its excesses, especially forced sterilizations and the restriction of civil
liberties, the major issues of its election campaign. The people also treated
the elections as a referendum on the Emergency. With the popular upsurge in
favour of them, the Janata Party and its allies were victorious with 330 out of
542 seats. Congress trailed far behind with only 154 seats, with CPI its ally
getting 7 and the AIADMK 21 seats. Congress was virtually wiped out in North
India—it won only 2 out of 234 seats in seven northern states. Both Indira
Gandhi and Sanjay were defeated. The electoral verdict was, however, mixed in
western India. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Surprisingly in the South, where the
Emergency had been less vigorous, and the pro-poor measures of the Twenty-Point
Programme better implemented, Congress improved its performance, winning 92
seats in place of 70 in 1971. Janata won only 6 seats in the four southern
states. The Congress for Democracy merged with Janata Party immediately after
the elections. There was a near-crisis over the issue of prime ministership
between the three aspirants, Morarji Desai, Charan Singh and Jagjivan Ram. The
matter was referred to the senior leaders, Jayaprakash Narayan and J.B. Kripalani,
who ruled in favour of the 81-year-old Desai, who was sworn in as prime
minister on 23 March. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>One of the first steps taken by the new
government was to try to consolidate its hold over the states. Arguing that in
those states where Congress had lost in national elections, it had also lost
the mandate to rule even at the state level, the government dismissed nine
Congress-ruled state governments, and ordered fresh elections to their state
assemblies. In the assembly elections, held in June 1977, Janata and its allies
came out victorious in these states except in Tamil Nadu where AIADMK won. In
West Bengal, the CPM, a Janata ally, gained an absolute majority. Control over
both the parliament and the state assemblies enabled the Janata Party to elect
unopposed its own candidate, N. Sanjeeva Reddy, as the President of the Union
in July 1977. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Janata government took immediate
steps to dismantle the authoritarian features of the Emergency regime and to
restore liberal democracy. It restored fundamental rights and full civil
liberties to the Press, political parties and individuals. Through the 44nd
Constitutional Amendment, it also modified the 42nd Amendment passed during the
Emergency, repealing those of its provisions which had distorted the
Constitution. The rights of the Supreme Court and High Courts to decide on the
validity of central or state legislation were also restored. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The political support to the Janata
regime, however, soon began to decline and disillusionment with it set in,
given its non-performance in administration, implementing developmental
policies, and realizing social justice. The political momentum of the regime
was lost by the end of 1977 and the uneasy coalition that was Janata Party
began to disintegrate, though the government remained in power till July 1979.
By then the lack of confidence in its capacity to govern had begun to turn into
anger, for several reasons. First, the Janata Party was not able to deal with
the rapidly growing social tensions in rural areas, of which the increasing
extent of atrocities on the rural poor and the Scheduled Castes was one
manifestation. Janata Party’s social base in North India consisted primarily of
rich and middle peasants belonging mostly to intermediate castes and large
landowners belonging to upper castes and the urban and rural shop-keepers,
small businessmen and the petty bourgeoisie. The rural landowners felt that
with the Janata governments at the Centre and the states, they had now
unalloyed power in the country as a whole and in rural areas in <span
class=0Text>110</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>particular. On the other hand, the rural
poor, mostly landless labourers and belonging largely to the Scheduled Castes
too had become conscious of their rights and felt emboldened by the prolonged
functioning of democracy and adult franchise. They also defended and asserted
the rights and benefits they had obtained under the Twenty-Point Programme. In
many states the landowners tried to forcibly take back the plots given to them
and the moneylenders began to reclaim debts cancelled during the Emergency. The
result was the wide prevalence of caste tensions and violent attacks on the
Scheduled Castes in North India, an early instance being the killing and
torching of Harijans at Belchi in Bihar in July 1977. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>There was recrudescence of large-scale
communal violence. There were growing agitations, lawlessness and violence
which particularly affected colleges and universities, often leading to their
closure. The middle of 1979 also witnessed a wave of strikes and mutinies by policemen
and paramilitary forces. Next, the Janata regime explicitly repudiated the
Nehruvian vision of rapid economic development based on large-scale industry,
modern agriculture, and advanced science and technology. But it failed to
evolve any alternative strategy or model of economic and political development
to deal with the problems of economic underdevelopment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Janata’s economic policy merely
counterposed rural development to industry-oriented growth. This policy came to
be based on three pillars: labour-intensive small-scale industry, not as
complementary to but in place of large-scale industry; decentralization in
place of national planning; and rich peasant-led agricultural development based
on generous subsidies, reduction in land revenue, and massive shift of
resources from industry to the rural sector. This shift in economic policy was
a recipe for low or non-economic development. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Interestingly, the Janata Party made no
effort to fulfill its earlier radical demands for land reform and payment of
higher wages to agricultural labourers. The one positive economic step that the
Janata government did undertake was the effort to provide employment to the
rural unemployed through the ‘Food for Work’ </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>programme, which was used to improve
village infrastructure such as roads, school buildings, etc., and which was
particularly efficiently implemented by the CPM government in West Bengal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>After the first year of Janata rule, the
economy started drifting with both agriculture and industry showing stagnation or
low rates of growth. Severe drought conditions and devastating floods in
several states affected agricultural production in 1978 and 1979. Prices began
to rise sharply, especially as foodgrains stocks had been used up in the ‘Food
for Work’ programme. International prices of petroleum and petroleum products
again rose steeply. The heavy deficit-financing in the 1979 budget, presented
by Charan Singh as finance minister, also had a marked inflationary impact.
1979 also witnessed widespread shortages of ker-osene and other goods of daily
consumption. By the end of that year, inflation had gone beyond 20 per cent. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Janata government’s tenure was too
brief for it to leave much of an impact on India’s foreign policy, though while
continuing to function within the existing, widely accepted framework; it did
try to reorient foreign policy. It talked of ‘genuine non-alignment’ which
meant strengthening ties with US and Britain and moderating its close relations
with the Soviet Union. Holding the party together seems to have been a major
preoccupation of the Janata leaders. Already disintegrating by the end of 1977,
by 1978-79, the government, lacking all direction, was completely paralyzed by
the constant bickering and infighting in the party both at the Centre and in
the states. Each political component tried to occupy as much political and
administrative space as possible. In the ideological sphere, the Jan Sangh
tried to promote its communal agenda via textbooks and recruitment to the
official media, educational institutions and the police. The Janata Party
remained a coalition of different parties and groups and was a victim of
factionalism, manipulation and personal ambitions of its leaders. The different
constituents were too disparate historically, ideologically and
programmatically; bound only by an anti-Indira Gandhi sentiment and the desire
for power. Jan Sangh, its best organized and dominant component with ninety
MPs, was populist with umbilical ties to RSS which provided it cadres and
ideology and which was not willing to let it be incorporated in or integrated
with other parties. Congress (O) was conservative and basically Congress in
mentality. BLD was secular, but a strictly rich-peasant party with no all-India
or developmental vision. The Socialists were largely ideology less and rootless
except in Bihar. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In the meanwhile, the Congress witnessed
both a split and a revival. Feeling that Indira Gandhi was not only a spent
force but, much worse, a serious political liability, a large number of
established Congress leaders, led by Y.B. Chavan and Brahmanand Reddy turned
against her. She, in turn, split the party in January 1978, with her wing being
known as Congress (I) (for Indira) and the other later, as Congress (U) (for
Devraj Urs). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Thereafter, Indira Gandhi’s political
fortunes began to revive and in the February 1978 elections to state assemblies
Congress (I) defeated both Janata and the rival Congress in Karnataka and
Andhra. There were two reasons for this revival. One was the Janata
government’s effort to wreak vengeance on Indira Gandhi and punish her for the
happenings of the Emergency. Several Commissions of Enquiry—the most famous
being the Shah Commission—were appointed to investigate and pinpoint the malpractices,
excesses, abuses and atrocities committed by Indira Gandhi and the officials
during the Emergency. In 1979, special courts were set up to try her for
alleged criminal acts during the Emergency. The common people, on the other
hand, began to increasingly view Indira Gandhi’s persecution not as justice but
as revenge and ven-detta and an effort to disgrace her. They felt she had
already been punished enough by being voted out of power. Moreover, deep down,
the rural and urban poor, Harijans, minorities and women still considered
Indira Gandhi as their saviour, their Indira Amma or Mother Indira. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, the government remained ignorant
of Indira Gandhi’s growing popularity, thanks to the bias of the Press against
her. A dramatic demonstration of her growing popularity came when she won a
parliament seat with a large margin from the Chikamagalur constituency in
Karnataka in November 1978. Ironically, soon after, on 19 December, Janata used
its majority to expel her from the parliament for breach of privilege and
contempt of the House on a minor charge and committed her to jail for a week. </span></p>

government on the refusal of the Jan Sangh members to give up their dual
membership of Janata Party and RSS. Having been reduced to a minority, Morarji
Desai’s government resigned on 15 July. A week later, Charan Singh formed the
government in alliance with the Chavan-wing of the Congress (U) and some of the
Socialists and with the outside support of Cong (I) and CPI. But he never got
to face the parliament as, on 20 August, a day before the confidence vote,
Indira Gandhi withdrew her support after Charan Singh rejected her demand for
the scrapping of special courts set up to prosecute her. On Charan Singh’s
advice, the President dissolved the Lok Sabha and announced mid-term elections.

disenchanted with Janata’s non-governance, lack of vision and incessant mutual
quarrels, the people once again turned to Congress and Indira Gandhi,
perceiving her Congress to be the real Congress. The Janata Party’s main appeal
consisted of warnings against the threat to democracy and civil liberties if
Indira Gandhi came back to power. Charan Singh talked of ‘peasant raj’. </span></p>

taking significant new policy initiatives or dealing effectively with a number
of disturbing problems. </span></p>

success in the fields of economic and foreign policy. But, on the whole, there
was a lack of direction and a sense of drift, which led to a feeling among the
people that not much was being achieved. The Emergency and the Janata years had
left their mark on her. She was suspicious of people around her and trusted
none but her son, Sanjay. Her earlier energy, decisiveness and determination
were replaced by ‘an approach of hesitation and caution’. As time passed she showed
signs of being a tired person</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

instruments to implement her election promises. Most of the well-known and
experienced national and state leaders and her colleagues of the past had
deserted her during 1977- 78. With a few exceptions, the political leaders
around her, in the Centre as also in the states, were raw untried men and
women, none of whom had a political base of their own and who had been chosen
more for their loyalty than for their administrative or political capacities.
Sanjay Gandhi’s death while flying a stunt plane on 23 June 1980 left her
shaken and further weakened. She tried to fill his place with her elder son,
Rajiv Gandhi, who was brought into politics, got elected as an MP and then
appointed as the general secretary of the party in 1983. </span></p>

Indira’s second prime ministerial innings was the continuing organizational
weakness of Congress and her failure to rebuild it and strengthen its
structure. This inevitability affected the performance of the government and
its popularity, for a weak party structure meant the chok-ing of channels
through which popular feelings could be conveyed to the leadership and the
nature and rationale of government policies explained to the people. </span></p>

of the party and the government, the central leadership of the party again
faced the problem of continuous factionalism and infighting—in fact, virtual
civil war—within the state units of the party and the state governments. One
result of this infighting and the consequent frequent rise and fall of chief
ministers was that party organizational elections were repeatedly postponed
and, in the end, not held. Another result was the erosion of the feeling that
Congress could provide state governments that worked. Organizational weakness
also began to erode the party’s support and adversely affect its electoral
performance, with dissidents often sabotaging the prospects of the official
party candidates. </span></p>

popularity was the serious electoral defeat it suffered in January 1983 in the
elections to the state assemblies of Andhra and Karnataka, the two states which
Congress had ruled continuously since their inception. In Andhra, Congress
suffered a massive defeat at the hands of the newly formed Telugu Desam party,
led by the film star-turned politician, N.T. Rama Rao. The Congress won only 60
seats against Telugu Desam’s 202. In Karnataka, a Janata-led front won 95 seats
in the 224-seat assembly, with Congress getting 81 seats. While facing hardly
any challenge at the Centre from opposition parties, from the beginning of her
second prime ministership Indira Gandhi faced certain intractable problems
arising out of communal, linguistic and caste conflicts; none of these was
dealt with firmness and insight and all of them were to drag on for years. </span></p>

economic order that would be more fair to the developing countries. When on 26
December 1979 the Soviet Union sent its troops into Afghanistan to help its
beleaguered government, Mrs. Gandhi refused to condemn die action but, at the
same time, she advised the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan
as speedily as possible. She, however, opposed the indirect intervention in
Afghanistan’s civil war by the United States and Pakistan. Mrs. Gandhi’s stand
on Afghanistan issue was determined by India’s long-term friendship and
‘special’ relationship with the Soviet Union and India’s strategic interest in
preventing Afghanistan from having an administrator hostile to India. </span></p>

While much of the hostile reaction to the Operation represented an emotional
outburst, there was a great deal to be said for its critics who held that some
other way than the military storming of the Temple should have been found.
Later, critics were to point to the success of the skillfully planned and
executed Operation Black Thunder in 1988 which forced the terrorists, once
again occupying the Temple in the manner similar to that of 1984, to surrender
to the police in a relatively bloodless manner. However, despite its many
negative repercussions, Operation Blue Star had certain positive features. It
established that the Indian state was strong enough to deal with secession and
terrorism; it put an end to the charismatic Bhindranwale and his gang; and it
restored law and order. Five months after the operation, on 31 October 1984,
Indira Gandhi was assassinated in an act of revenge by her two Sikh bodyguards,
Satwant Singh and Beant Singh. Public outcry over Indira Gandhi’s death led to

of Jawaharlal Nehru, became prime minister of India on the night of 31 October
1985. That morning, Indira Gandhi was shot by two of her own body-guards. Rajiv
Gandhi, a pilot with Indian Airlines for fourteen years, had kept studiously
aloof from politics till the death of his younger brother, Sanjay, in an air
crash in June 1980. After Sanjay’s death, Indira persuaded him to help her and
in June 1981 he formally entered politics by getting elected to the Lok Sabha
from Amethi, the constituency in U.P. vacated by Sanjay’s death. He was placed
in charge of organizing the Asian Games in New Delhi in 1982, and by all
accounts did a commendable job. In February 1983, he became one of the seven
new general secretaries of the Congress, with the responsibility of
rejuvenating the Congress at the grassroots, the urgency of the task having
been brought home by losses in provincial elections. But the gradual
appren-ticeship to politics was cut short and he was catapulted into the
driving seat. With elections due in a few months, Congress leaders naturally
wanted someone who could rally the people. Rajiv, in their judgement, was most
likely to harness the sympathy wave generated by Indira’s martyrdom. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

correct, and the Congress won by its largest ever majority in the general
elections held from 24-27 December 1984, a little earlier than scheduled. If
the seats won in the polls held later in Punjab and Assam are counted, the
party garnered 415 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats. Rajiv himself won by a huge
margin from Amethi in U.P., in the process defeating conclusively Sanjay
Gandhi’s wife, Maneka, who wanted to establish her claim to Sanjay’s legacy.
The Congress election campaign had focused on the threat to India’s unity and
integrity and, since Indira’s death was seen by people as proof of the threat,
the response was enormous. The huge majority also meant high, even unreal,
expectations, which Rajiv himself once described as ‘scary’. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

of Sikhs in revenge for her assassination was taking <span class=0Text>118</span></span></p>

death, to 3 November, many Sikhs were attacked, their businesses and houses
looted and burnt, and around 2,800 killed. The perpetrators were the poor,
usually slum-dwellers, who looked upon Indira as their leader and sympathizer,
and were disoriented by her violent death. It has also been alleged that
Congress party workers and even some local level leaders were involved in
assisting and guiding the crowd, and that the police at the local level turned
a blind eye to what was going on. This allegation has sometimes been enlarged
into a broader charge that the Congress, with directions from the top,
organized the massacre, a charge that is obviously unfounded and has been
impossible to prove. It is also true that thousands of Sikhs were sheltered and
protected by Hindu friends and neighbours. The government’s delay in bringing
the situation under control can only be explained by the confusion following
Indira’s assassination, with the swearing-in of the new prime minister, the
responsibility of arranging the funeral, which was attended by thousands of people,
and looking after the foreign guests. It also took a while for the full import
of the scale of the massacre to be communicated and understood at the higher
levels of the government. On 3 November, the day of the funeral, Rajiv visited
some of the affected areas in the morning, and later the army was called in and
the violence suppressed. Many voluntary agencies, whose personnel were
generally Hindu, worked for months to bring relief to the families of victims.
Similar violence, though on a smaller scale, broke out in some other North
Indian cities, especially Kanpur and Bokaro. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Despite these travails, Rajiv’s
administration took off on a positive note, and a number of policy initiatives
were launched. At the political level, he set in motion the process that
culminated in the Punjab and Assam accords, which have been discussed elsewhere
in the book. But perhaps his most well-known initiative was the setting up of
six ‘technology missions’, something that for many Indians epitomized the new,
modern and technological approach of the youthful prime minister. The idea was
to apply science and technology to six areas of underdevelopment in which a
scientific approach would be useful in solving problems. These target-oriented
projects were designated as ‘technology missions’ and in most cases the arrival
of the millennium was set as the target date, the idea being that India must
enter the new millennium as a modern nation. The most important of these was
the drinking water mission, whose aim was to provide drinking water to all
Indian villages, only one-fifth of which had potable water supplies. The idea
was to use satellites and the disciplines of geology, civil engineering and
biochemistry for identifying, extracting and cleansing water supplies. The
literacy mission was aimed at attacking the serious problem of mass illiteracy
which almost forty years after independence afflicted almost sixty per cent of
the population. This was to be achieved by making use of and extending the
television network in rural areas, as well as by using video and audio
cassettes and other methods. In fact, this was probably in the long run the
most significant of the missions, as the Total Literacy Campaign that it
spawned made a major dent in many regions and brought the whole issue to the
centre of political debate. The third mission was targeted at the immunization
of pregnant women and children, again an idea that has caught on and is pursued
with greater vigour today with the mass campaign for immunization of children
against polio being a recent example. The fourth mission was to promote the
‘White Revolution’, or milk production, by improving the milk yield and health
of cows and buffaloes, and this was remarkably successful. India imported a
large quantity of edible oils, which added considerably to her foreign exchange
deficit, and the fifth mission was charged with the task of expanding edible

every village in the country by the end of the century. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The man who inspired and helped implement
the technology-mission approach was Sam Pitroda, a young US-trained Indian
telecommunications expert who had made a fortune in the US from telephone
switching systems. He had convinced Mrs. Gandhi of the need to set up C-Dot or
the Centre for the Development of Telematics, and he now became Rajiv’s adviser
on technology missions, and Telecom Commission chairman. A big push was also
given by Rajiv to India’s computerization programme, which was already being
formulated under Mrs. Gandhi. Import duties on components were reduced so that
domestic producers could enhance production, foreign manufacturers were allowed
to enter the home market so that quality and competitive prices were ensured,
and use of computers in offices and schools was encouraged. Realizing that the
future was at stake, Rajiv ignored much ill-informed debate about utility of
computers in a labour surplus society, and went ahead with the policy that has
stood the country in very good stead, with computer software emerging as a
major foreign exchange earner. India had missed out on the industrial
revolution because of its colonial status, and it was imperative that she take
part in the information and communication revolution (this was a view held by
many farsighted Indians, and Rajiv shared it and put his weight behind the
effort to make it come real). Efforts at liberalization of controls in the
economy as a whole, increase of exports, reduction of import duties, etc. were
also made. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Much lip service had been paid to the
need for doing something to strengthen local self-government institutions. It
was Rajiv and his government that took the initiative to deepen and strengthen
Panchayati institutions by generating debate and bringing forward legislation
to make panchayat elections mandatory by giving them a constitutional sanction.
This necessitated a constitutional amendment and it was Rajiv’s great regret
that the opposition parties, for no good reason, blocked the passage of the
bills in the Rajya Sabha where the Congress did not have a majority. As
striking as the objective was the process. Between December 1987 and June 1988,
Rajiv met 400 district collectors or officers in charge of districts. In July 1988
there was a meeting with chief secretaries, the highest officers of states, in
January 1989 a Panchayati Raj sammelan of 8,000 delegates, followed by a
conference on Panchayati Raj for Women in May. The All India Congress Committee
discussed and supported the proposals in May 1989, and a meeting of chief
ministers of states was held thereafter. Rajiv could claim with some justice,
as he did, that ‘never before has a government at the highest level taken so
carefully into account the views of so many tens of thousands of people at
every level about democracy and development at the grassroots.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Another measure directed at the rural
poor was the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana or Employment Plan which aimed at providing
employment to at least one member of every rural poor family for 50-100 days in
the year. Inaugurated to mark the birth centenary of Jawaharlal Nehru (born in
1889), the central government promised to meet 80 per cent of the cost of the
scheme. The new education policy, too, had its focus on the rural areas and the
poor, with its main planks being the literacy campaign, Operation Blackboard
(which aimed at providing basic amenities to schools) and distance education.
The much reviled Navodaya Vidya-layas, a favourite whipping boy of Rajiv
baiters, and cited <span class=1Text>ad nauseum </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>as proof of the elitist nature of Rajiv’s
education policy, were in fact aimed at providing quality education to the
children of poor rural families who were to be chosen by merit for free
education and stay in the residential schools to be set up in every district.
The National Perspective Plan for Women was drafted in 1988, and among its
important proposals was the reservation of 30 per cent of elected seats for
women in all panchayat bodies, which was included in the Panchayati Raj legislation.
It also recommended that 50 per cent of grassroots functionaries should be
women. The plan addressed issues of women’s health and education as well.
Legislation strengthening the punishment for dowry-related offences was also
passed in 1986. </span></p>

project close to Rajiv’s heart as it had been to his mother’s, and among other
things he launched a massive effort to clean the river Ganga, the holiest of
Indian rivers, which had become shamefully polluted in many parts. He created a
new Ministry for Environment and environmental clearance for big projects was
made mandatory. At the Non-Aligned Movement’s ninth summit, he placed before it
the proposal for a Planet Protection Fund to help developing countries access
advanced technology for the protection of the environment. While it became
quite fashionable in certain elite circles to berate the cultural policy of the
Rajiv government as catering to the West by holding very expensive festivals of
India in many western countries, it was forgotten that at the same time seven
zonal cultural cen-120</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>tres were set up in different parts of
the country to shift the focus of state patronage of the arts away from the
capital and encourage local and regional cultural forms. Also, whatever their
criticism (there is some truth in the charge of over-enthusiasm leading to
precious cultural property being transported abroad and suffering damage,
though whether this was a special feature of Rajiv’s regime is suspect) the
festivals did succeed in placing India on the world cultural map. If one of the
legitimate functions of a government is to enhance the standing of the country
it governs on the world stage, then the festivals of India fulfilled that
function. There appeared to be a serious effort to clean up the political and
bureaucratic system, by introducing greater openness, accountability, and
taking legislative and other measures to dissuade offenders. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Among these was the Anti-Defection Act,
drafted after discussions with opposition parties and passed in 1985, which
laid down that one-third of the members of a political party in the parliament
would have to change loyalties for it to be recognized as a split in a party.
Any other defections would invite expulsion from the House. This was meant to
check the tendency of horse-trading and shifting party loyalties that was
becoming a bane of the Indian political system. Lok Adalats and the Consumer
Protection Act were part of the same stream. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Greater freedom to government media,
especially the increasingly popular television, and encouragement to programmes
critical of government and intended to keep ministers and bureaucrats on their
toes, carried the prime minister’s personal imprint. V. P. Singh’s much
advertised raids on business houses, which Rajiv supported, certainly in the
beginning, also helped provide the ambience that gave Rajiv the Mr. Clean
label. But it was his speech at the centenary celebrations of the Congress in
December 1985 that really shook critics and admirers (and at that time there
were more admirers than critics, as Rajiv enjoyed a honeymoon for the first
eighteen months of his term). Rajiv used the occasion to launch a frontal
attack on what he described as the power-brokers who had reduced the great
party to a shell of its former self, and promised to rejuvenate it by removing
their stranglehold. This was read as a signal to the old leaders to get their
act together or else. Many party men who were otherwise sympathetic to Rajiv’s
policies did not appreciate his ‘disrespectful’ style and thought the centenary
of the grand old party an inappropriate occasion for this exercise. However,
Rajiv was no more successful at holding elections within the party than was his
mother or his successor as Congress prime minister. The hold of party bosses at
the local level meant that they could register bogus members and manipulate
elections, and in the process acquire further legitimacy by virtue of being
elected! Rajiv soon also found that he needed to build links with party stalwarts
and politics was different from running an efficient corporation. Over time,
and partly as his own close advisers, Arun Nehru, Arun Singh, and V. P. Singh,
were estranged, he brought back old advisers. The process reached full circle
in early 1989 with the return of R.K. Dhawan, Mrs. Gandhi’s close adviser, who
epitomized the old system that Rajiv had vowed in his innocence in December
1985 to overturn! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Rajiv pursued foreign affairs with the
energy of an activist, travelling extensively to countries big and small, and
participating in a wide range of international fora. He put his own personal
stamp on foreign policy, even while pursuing the well-laid out path of his
grandfather and mother. This he did by zealously advocating the causes of
nuclear disarmament and the fight against apartheid in South Africa and of
Namibian independence. A little while before her death, Indira had formed the
Six-Nation Five-Continent Initiative, bringing together heads of government of
Argentina, Greece, Mexico, Sweden, Tanzania and India, to put international
pressure on superpowers to reduce weapons and eliminate nuclear weapons. Within
a month of winning the elections, Rajiv held the first summit of the six
leaders. It is important to remember that this was before Gorbachev’s
assumption of power and before disarmament was on the agenda of superpower
relations. Rajiv met Gorbachev after he took over the reins in the USSR, and
found in him a believer in disarmament. In fact, Rajiv began to hail Gorbachev
as a force for peace much before the US woke up to the new leader’s new ideas.
In November 1986, on the occasion of Gorbachev’s visit, he and Rajiv gave a
call for a non-violent world, and the Delhi Declaration, as the programme came
to be called, set forth a plan for disarmament. The Six Nation Initiative too
matured into a Action Plan for Nuclear Disarmament, which Rajiv then presented
to the UN General Assembly’s third special session on disarmament in June 1988.
This plan called for the elimination of all nuclear weapons by 2010. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Close to Rajiv’s heart was the struggle
against apartheid in South Africa. In keeping with tradition (Gandhiji was the
first to take up the issue in South Africa in 1893, and Nehru the first to
raise it in the UN in the late forties, and India the first country to apply
sanctions by breaking-off trade and diplomatic links.), Rajiv took up the cause
with fervour, even succeeding in getting the majority in the Commonwealth in
favour of sanctions but failing to move an obdurate Mrs. Thatcher. More
successful was the setting up of the AFRICA (Action for Resisting Invasion,
Colonialism and Apartheid) Fund at the nonaligned summit at Harare in 1986. </span></p>

SWAPO, the organization fighting for Namibian independence, and visited the
frontline states of Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Tanzania in May 1986, besides
adding his voice to the cause at all international gatherings. Namibia got her
independence in 1990, by which time Rajiv was no longer prime minister, but he
attended the celebrations, where he met Nelson Mandela, and thus was able to
witness the success of two favourite causes. Relations with the superpowers
improved during Rajiv’s tenure, but did not undergo any major change. Contrary
to speculation based on the young PM’s preference for open-market policies and
a technocratic bias, Rajiv did not tilt towards the US. His visit to the US in
1985 was a successful one, and he got along well with Reagan, even persuading
him to let India have the supercomputer she had been wanting for processing her
weather data. But with the US committed to supporting Pakistan, to promote the
Mujahideen against the USSR in Afghanistan, there was little chance of any
radical shifts. With Gorbachev, however, a very close relationship developed,
and the two leaders met a total of eight times in five years. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Rajiv’s visit to China in 1988, the first
by an Indian prime minister since Nehru’s maiden visit in 1954, was remarkable
in that it happened at all. It was also made memorable by TV images of Deng
holding on to Rajiv’s hand for what seemed like eternity, and by his referring
to mistakes made by people of his generation which the new generation
represented by Rajiv Gandhi should not repeat. The importance of this meeting
was also because there had been a sudden dip in relations in 1986 following
some border incidents. The visit was followed by efforts to solve long-standing
problems on a regular basis, improvement of trade and extension of consular
contacts. India even refrained from condemning the Tiananmen Square massacre of
4 June 1989, clear proof that recent improvements in relations were sought not
to be jeopardized. With immediate neighbours, relations were not very good
during Rajiv’s time. Bangladesh was moving in a more and more Islamic
direction, and disputes over water continued. With Nepal there was trouble,
their government imposed heavy duties on Indian goods, gave discounts in duties
to Chinese goods, received, in 1988, huge amounts of assault rifles and
antiaircraft guns from China and asked Indian residents to get work permits for
working in Nepal (this when lakhs of Nepalis work and live in India without any
permits). The Indian government imposed what amounted to an economic blockade
in March 1989, and by September negotiations for a solution began. </span></p>

were much the same despite hopes aroused by Benazir Bhutto becoming prime
minister, and Rajiv visiting Pakistan (the first prime minister to do so after
Nehru), what with Pakistani support to insurgency in Kashmir and Punjab
continuing apace. In Sri Lanka, however, India got involved in a messy
situation from which she found it difficult to extricate herself. The problem
began when thousands of Tamils from Sri Lanka fled to Tamil Nadu in India in
1983 when the Sri Lankan government launched heavy repression on Jaffna, the
base of the LTTE, an organization fighting for Tamil autonomy and later,
independence from Sri Lanka. Public opinion in India, especially in Tamil Nadu,
whose people spoke the same language as the refugees, was strongly in favour of
India doing something to help the Sri Lankan Tamils. </span></p>

President Jayewardene approached Rajiv, and the negotiations led to an accord
in July 1987 by which the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka where
Tamils were the majority would be merged into a single province, substantial
devolution of power would take place, the LTTE would be dissolved and arms
surrendered in a very short time, and the Indian Army would come to the aid of
the Sri Lankan government if requested by Sri Lanka. The accord failed to take
off because the LTTE had given only reluctant consent, were not signatories,
and did not trust the Sri Lankan government, and refused to surrender.
Jayewardene, in the meantime, asked for the Indian Army to help implement the
accord, and since it was the LTTE that was standing in the way, the army got
involved in an increasingly messy fight with the Tamil guerillas, who had an
edge since they knew the terrain and had local support. The Indian Army was in
an unenviable position with Tamils resenting it because it was disarming the
LTTE, and Sri Lankans resenting it for being a foreign army. The situation got
even messier with Premadasa succeeding Jayewardene and asking the Indian
government to withdraw its army. Rajiv agreed to a phased withdrawal, and the
soldiers started to come home in mid-1989, but withdrew fully only after the
1989 elections. The Sri Lankan imbroglio was to cost Rajiv his life. </span></p>

known to India that it wanted to withdraw from Kampuchea which it had occupied
a few years ago and that it wished India to work out the modalities in
consultation with other countries. Natwar Singh, the Minister of State for
External Affairs, did a lot of shuttle diplomacy in South-east Asia, met the
deposed Kampuchean ruler Prince Sihanouk a number of times in Paris, arranged
meetings between Sihanouk and Heng Samarian. As a settlement approached, the US
and China got into the act and tried to sideline India. A twenty-one nation

nuclear-powered submarine from USSR and the purchase of a second aircraft

Aftermath-</span></span><span lang=EN> Ironically, it was these very same
defence purchases that were to become the proverbial albatross around Rajiv’s
neck. The big one was Bofors, the stink of which continues to this day, but it
started with smaller scandals around Fairfax and the HDW submarine deal. Very
briefly, since details are available aplenty elsewhere, the Fairfax controversy
centred on the appointment by V. P. Singh, Rajiv’s finance minister, who had become
notorious for his ‘raid raj’, of an American detective agency, Fairfax, to
investigate the illegal stacking of foreign exchange in overseas banks by
Indians. A forged letter which suggested that the investigations included
Amitabh Bachchan, a close friend of the prime minister, surfaced from nowhere,
and big industrialists, Nusli Wadia of Bombay Dyeing and Ambani of Reliance
were reported to be involved in the game on opposite sides. The transfer of V.
P. Singh from Finance to Defence, which Rajiv claimed was because he needed
somebody capable to handle Defence at the time because of the crisis with
Pakistan, was projected by the Opposition as proof that Rajiv was trying to
shield his friend Amitabh. This was followed by the HDW submarine scandal. When
India wanted to place a further order for two more submarines with the HDW
shipyard in West Germany from whom it had bought four in 1981, and asked for
some price discount, the shipyard declined saying it had to pay heavy 7 per
cent commission on the sale anyway. V. P. Singh, who was defence minister,
without speaking to Rajiv, ordered an enquiry. This was taken as an unfriendly
act since Mrs. Gandhi herself was defence minister at the time of the award of
the contract in 1981, and a Congress government was in power. </span></p>

April 1987, a few days after Singh’s resignation, the Bofors scandal broke. The
allegations, which first appeared on Swedish Radio, were that the equivalent of
sixty crores of Indian rupees were paid as bribes to Indian officials and
Congress party members to secure the contract for the 410 howitzer guns to
Bofors company of Sweden in face of stiff competition from a French gun. The
allegations, which were taken up in a big way by the Indian Press, particularly

himself with sections of the opposition parties charging that he and his family
were the recipient of the money. The situation was bad enough for Rajiv to make
a public denial of his and his family’s involvement. It also provided an
opportunity to Giani Zail Singh, the President, to try and settle scores with
Rajiv. Annoyed because Rajiv had been lax in observing the convention of
regularly calling on the President to keep him informed of important
developments, and also because he was not consulted about the Punjab and Mizo
accords, and lured by the prospect of a second term, Zail Singh became the
centre of a major conspiracy in mid-1987 to dismiss Rajiv from office.
Opposition leaders and some Congress dissidents encouraged the President to
dismiss Rajiv on charges of corruption or failing to fulfil the constitutional
requirement of keeping the President informed. Zail Singh was almost persuaded
but V. P. Singh, who was the alternative, declined to play the game and a major
constitutional catastrophe was saved. </span></p>

affecting one-fourth of the population of the country, living in one-third of
all districts located in eleven states. A massive effort was launched to move
food and drinking water, and to start employment schemes, in affected areas. It

neighbours were on an even keel, somewhat better, certainly no worse than
before. The economy had done well, registering the highest rates of growth to
date, though the deficit and debt was piling up. The security and defence
policy had been a sound one with the overdue modernization of the armed forces
set in motion. Computerization was given a big push, a necessity if India was
to remain in the reckoning in the world system. Anti-poverty programmes in

Bano’s husband had asked her to move to a separate residence three years
before, after a prolonged period of her living with Khan and his second wife.
Shah Bano went to court and filed a claim for maintenance for herself and her
five children under Section 123 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The
section puts a legal obligation on a man to provide for his wife during the
marriage and after divorce too if she isn’t able to fend for herself. However,
Khan contested the claim on the grounds that the Muslim Personal Law in India
required the husband to only provide maintenance for the iddat period after
divorce. </span></p>

neglected wife, child or parent? Neglect by a person of sufficient means to
maintain these and the inability of these persons to maintain themselves are
the objective criteria which determine the applicability of section 125. Such
provisions, which are essentially of a prophylactic nature, cut across the
barriers of religion. The liability imposed by section 125 to maintain close

the price levels. The rise in price increases the government expenditure faster
than the receipts, hence increasing the deficit. Since 1950, India ran into
continuous trade deficit because of quota license inspector raj. The fiscal

aggravates the fiscal deficit which was brought to balance by reducing these

liberalisation was paved by the government to balance the deficit. Various tax
reforms were introduced to make tax structure more stable and transparent. Some
of them include the reduction of tax brackets to 3 with rates of 20%, 30% and
40. The role of monetary reform in balancing the deficit was also significant.
The reduction in statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and the cash reserve ratio
(CRR) and guidelines for opening new private sector banks were part of some
monetary policies. The rationale behind these reforms was to bring in
competition among public sector, private sector and foreign banks. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Land program in post-Independence India
has evolved through different phases. During the Mughal period, before the arrival
of the British there were numerous changes in the system of land taxation or
revenue. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Peasants continued to enjoy customary
rights over land they occupied and generally could not be evicted unless they
failed to pay the required land revenue (land tax) to the state. The task of
collecting land revenue was assigned to a class of agents called zamindars. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>When the East India Company (EIC)
established in the Seventeenth Century, the agricultural structure underwent
fundamental change. The EIC first purchased the right to receive the collected
land revenue and later, under the Permanent Settlement introduced in 1793,
declared the Zamindars to be proprietors of land in exchange for the payment of
land revenue fixed in perpetuity. Zamindars or those to whom they sold their
proprietary rights, typically delegated revenue collection to a series of
middlemen. The increasing layers of intermediaries meant that there was
considerable increase in rent extracted from the tillers and failure to pay
this increased amount resulted in large-scale evictions, widespread
disturbance, and declining agricultural production. The British sought to
stabilize the situation through legislated tenancy reform. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Bengal Rent Act of 1859 placed
restrictions on the power of landlords’ to increase rent or evict tenants. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, the Act only protected

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>But it only protected those fixed-rent
tenants who could prove they had cultivated the land for 12 consecu-tive years.
Constant cultivation was difficult to prove due to poor records and the Act
resulted in an increase in evictions by Zamindars to prevent tenants from
possessing land for the required time period. The 1885 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Bengal Tenancy Act also sought to protect
long-standing tenants, and was similarly ineffective. During this period,
another form of landholder emerged in Bengal. The Jotedars were a rich class of
peasants who reclaimed and gained control of large quantities of uncultivated
forests and wetlands outside the territory governed by the Permanent
Settlement. The Jotedars refined some of this land through the direct
supervision of hired labour or servants. Nevertheless, the bulk of the
Jotedars’ land, like much of the land in Bengal, was cultivated by Bargadars. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Rural tensions over the dilemma of
Bargadars were common in the decades prior to and after Independence. In the
1940s, the Tebhaga movement called for a smaller crop share payment and also
created the slogan, “He who tills the land, owns the land.” The movement is
given credit for shaping post-Independence land reform legislation in West
Bengal (Datta, 1988). At the time of Independence, this matter was of great
significance. In the decades following independence India passed a significant
body of land reform legislation. The 1949 Constitution left the adoption and
implementation of land and tenancy reforms to state governments. This led to a
lot of dissimilarity in the implementation of these reforms across states and
over time. After India Independence, the government took major step to
eradicate the systems of Zamindaris and Jagirdari, to remove intermediaries
between state and peasant. This was the first legislature taken by almost all
the states called as Abolition of Zamindari / Jagirdari systems Act. </span></p>

tenancy regulation that attempts to improve the contractual terms faced by
tenants, including crop shares and security of tenure, a ceiling on
landholdings with a view to redistributing surplus land to the landless and

implementation of these reforms by directly using their political influence and
also by using various methods of evasion and coercion, which included
registering their own land under names of different relatives to bypass the
ceiling, and shuffling tenants around different plots of land, so that they
would not acquire incumbency rights as stipulated in the tenancy law. The
success of land reform was driven by the political will of particular state
administrations, the prominent achievers being the left-wing administrations in
Kerala and West Bengal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The process of land reform after
independence basically occurred in two broad phases. The first phase which
started soon after independence and arguably continued till the early sixties
focussed on the following features: 1) abolition of intermediaries—zamindars,
jagirdars, etc., 2) tenancy reforms involving providing security of tenure to
the tenants, decrease in rents and conferment of ownership rights to tenants,
3) ceilings on size of landholdings, 4) cooperativization and community
development programmes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>This phase has also been called the phase
of institutional reforms. The second phase beginning around the mid- or late
sixties saw the gradual ushering in of the so-called Green Revolution and has

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Within a year or two of independence,
i.e. by 1949, zamindari abolition bills or land tenure legislation were
introduced in a number of provinces such as U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Bihar,
Madras, Assam and Bombay with the report of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition
Committee (chaired by G.B. Pant) acting as the initial model for many others.
In the meantime, the Constituent Assembly was in the process of framing India’s
Constitution. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>There was, however, widespread
apprehension, including among Congress leaders deeply committed to zamindari
abolition like Jawaharlal Nehru, G.B. Pant and Sardar Patel, that the zamindars
could try to stymie the acquisition of their estates by moving the courts,
raising issues like the violation of right to property or ‘unjustness’ of the
compensation. After prolonged discussion the relevant provisions of the
Constitution were framed in a manner that the leaders felt assured that the
zamindari abolition bills pending in the state assemblies would go through on
the basis of compensation recommended by the state legislatures as these <span
class=0Text>134</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>recommendations were made
non-justiciable, requiring only presidential assent which meant ultimately the
support of the Union Cabinet. The compensation recommended by the legislatures
was of course expected to be small and reasonable from the tenants’ point of
view. It is significant that there was a wide consensus on giving the
legislatures the authority to prescribe principles of compensation on expropriation
of the zamindars. The acquisition of commercial or industrial property
continued to require an entirely different set of principles. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, belying the expectation of the
framers of the Constitution, the zamindars in various parts of the country
challenged the constitutionality of the law permitting zamindari abolition and
the courts, as for example, the Patna High Court upheld the landlords’ suit.
The Congress government responded by getting constitutional amendments passed.
The 1st Amendment in 1951 and the 4th Amendment in 1955 were aimed at further
strengthening the hands of the state legislatures for implementing zamindari
abolition, making the question of violation of any fundamental right or
insufficiency of compensation not permissible in the courts. Though the
zamindars continued to make numerous appeals to the High Court and Supreme
Court, if for no other purpose but to delay the acquisition of their estates,
yet, the back of their resistance was broken by the mid-fifties. It may be
reiterated that, contrary to a view often put forward, the framers of the
Constitution, including the so-called ‘right wing’ were not participating in a
design to stymie land reforms but were in fact trying to complete the process
within a democratic framework. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>A major difficulty in implementing the
zamindari abolition acts, passed in most provinces by 1956, was the absence of
adequate land records. Nevertheless, certainly by the end of the fifties
(though essentially by 1956) the process of land reform involving abolition of
intermediaries (the zamindars of British India, and jagirdars of the princely
states now merged with independent India) can be said to have been completed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

occurred in a democratic framework, with virtually no coercion or violence

partly because the zamindars as a class had been isolated socially during the
national movement itself as they were seen as part of the imperialist camp. But
reforms which threatened the interests of sections of the upper peasantry who
were very much part of the national movement and had considerable societal
support were far more difficult, and sometimes impossible to achieve. </span></p>

households under tenancy are highly unreliable partly because in many areas a
very large proportion of tenancy was ‘oral’ and therefore unrecorded. Yet,
scholars agree that there was some decline in tenancy after the reforms
started, one rough estimate being that area under tenancy decreased from about
42 per cent in 1950-51 to between 20 to 25 per cent by the early sixties.
However, the decline in tenancy and the considerable increase in
self-cultivation was not a result only of tenants becoming landowners but also
of eviction of existing tenants by landowners, as we shall see presently. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The compensation actually paid to the
zamindars once their estates were acquired was generally small and varied from
state to state depending upon the strength of the peasant movement and
consequent class balance between the landlords and the tenants and the
ideological composition of the Congress leadership and of the legislature as a
whole. In Kashmir, for example, no compensation was paid. In Punjab, the
occupancy tenants of Patiala were paid nothing and even the inferior tenants
given a negligible amount, often just the first installment of the total compensation
to be paid over a number of years. Most states followed a variation of the
model worked out in U.P., where, very significantly, the compensation paid was
inversely related to the size of the land which came under a zamindar. The
small zamindars (they were often hardly distinguishable from the well-to-do
peasants; land reform initiatives were quite consciously not directed against
them) who used to pay land revenue of upto Rs 25 were to receive about twenty
times their net annual income as compensation whereas the big zamindars who
paid land revenue ranging between Rs 2,000 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>to Rs 10,000 were to receive merely two
to four times their net annual income. Moreover the payment of compensation was
to stretch over a long period, in some cases forty years. It is estimated that
the big zamindars who did receive compensation found that their incomes from
alienated land, through compensation, would fetch them only one-fortieth of
their earlier income. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>There were however certain important
weaknesses in the manner in which some of the clauses relating to zamindari
abolition were implemented in various parts of the country. For example, in
U.P., the zamindars were permitted to retain lands that were declared to be
under their ‘personal cultivation’. What constituted </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘personal cultivation’ was very loosely
defined ‘(making) it possible for not only those who tilled the soil, but also
those who supervised the land personally or did so through a relative, or
provided capital and credit to the land, to call themselves a cultivator.’
Moreover, in states like U.P., Bihar and Madras, to begin with (i.e., till land
ceiling laws were introduced) there was no limit on the size of the lands that
could be declared to be under the ‘personal cultivation’ of the zamindar. This,
despite the fact that the Congress Agrarian Reforms Committee (Kumarappa
Committee) in its report of 1949 had clearly stipulated that ‘only those who
put in a minimum amount of physical labour and participate in actual agricultural
operations’ could be said to be performing ‘personal cultivation’. Also, the
committee had envisaged a limit or ceiling on how much land could be ‘resumed’
for ‘personal cultivation’, under no circumstances leading to the tenant’s
holding being reduced to below the ‘economic’ level. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The result in actual practice, however,
was that even zamindars who were absentee landowners could now end up retaining
large tracts of land. Further, in many areas, the zamindars in order to declare
under </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘personal cultivation’ as large a
proportion of their lands as possible often resorted to large-scale eviction of
tenants, mainly the less secure small tenants. (This was to be followed by
further rounds of evictions once the land ceilings and tenancy legislations came
into being, cumulatively leading to a major blot in the record of land reforms
in India). Many of the erstwhile essentially rent-receiving zamindars however
did actually begin to manage the lands declared under their ‘personal
cultivation’. They invested in them and moved towards progressive capitalist
farming in these areas, as this was indeed one of the objectives of the land
reform. Retaining large tracts under ‘personal cultivation’ was only one way
through which the landlords tried to avoid the full impact of the effort at
abolition of the zamindari system. Several other methods were used to resist
the bringing in of zamindari abolition legislation and their implementation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Since such legislation had to be passed
by the state legislatures, the landlords used every possible method of
parliamentary obstruction in the legislatures. The draft bills were subjected
to prolonged debates, referred to select committees and repeated amendments
were proposed so that in many states like U.P. and Bihar several years passed
between the introduction of the bills and the laws being enacted. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Even after the laws were enacted the
landlords used the judicial system to defer the implementation of the laws. As
we saw earlier, they repeatedly challenged the constitutionally of the laws in
the courts, going right up to the Supreme Court. In Bihar, where the landlords
put up the maximum resistance, they tried to block the implementation of the
law even after they lost their case in the Supreme Court twice. They now
refused to hand over the land records in their possession, forcing the
government to go through the lengthy procedure of reconstructing the records.
Further, implementation of the law was made difficult and, as much as possible,
skewed in favour of the zamindar, by the collusion between the landlords and
particularly the lower level revenue officials. Such collusion was helped by
the fact that in zamindari areas many of the revenue officials were former
rent-collecting agents of the zamindars. At all levels involving the
legislative, judicial and executive arms of the state, the landlords put up
resistance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Congress responded by repeatedly
reiterating its resolve to complete the process of zamindari abolition as
quickly as possible. This resolve was seen in AICC resolutions (e.g. that of
July 1954), in the conference of the chief ministers and presidents of
provincial congress committees (April 1950), in the First Plan document and
most of all in the Congress election manifestoes. Democracy with adult
franchise on the one hand reduced the political weight of the zamindars, and on
the other increased the urgency of meeting the long-standing demands of the
peasantry. The Congress itself had over the years mobilized the peasantry <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>to make these demands. The Congress also
took necessary administrative and legislative steps, such as getting the
constitutional amendments of 1951 and 1955 passed by parliament, which would
meet the challenge put up by the landlords. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Despite the resistance of the landlords,

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The typically large ‘feudal’ estates were
gone. While the big landlords, who lost the bulk of their lands, were the chief
losers, the main beneficiaries of zamindari abolition were the occupancy
tenants or the upper tenants, who had direct leases from the zamindar, and who
now became landowners. Such tenants were generally middle or rich peasants who
sometimes had subleases given out to lower tenants with little rights, often
called ‘tenants at will’. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The issue of continuing tenancy in
zamindari areas, oral and unrecorded, therefore remained even after abolition
of zamindari was implemented. Such tenancy existed in the lands of the former
zamindars now said to be under their ‘personal cultivation’ as well as in the
lands sub-leased by the former occupancy tenant who now became the landowner.
Moreover, at independence only about half the area was under zamindari tenure.
The other half was under ryotwari where the problems of landlordism and an
insecure, rack-rented tenantry too were rampant. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The second major plank of the land
reforms envisaged was, therefore, concerned with tenancy legislation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The political and economic conditions in
different parts of India were so varied that the nature of tenancy legislation
passed by the different states and the manner of their implementation also
varied a great deal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Yet, there were certain commonly shared
objectives of the various legislations and over time some common broad features
emerged in the manner of their implementation in most parts of the country. It
is an examination of only these common aspects rather than of the myriad
differences that is possible within the scope of this study. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Tenancy reforms had three basic
objectives. First, to guarantee security of tenure to tenants who had
cultivated a piece of land continuously for a fixed number of years, say six
years (the exact number of years varied from region to region). Second, to seek
the reduction of rents paid by tenants to a ‘fair’ level which was generally
considered to range between one-fourth to one-sixth of the value of the gross
produce of the leased land. The third objective was that the tenant gain the
right to acquire ownership of the lands he cultivated, subject to certain
restrictions. The tenant was expected to pay a price much below the market
price, generally a multiple of the annual rent, say eight or ten years’ rent.
For example, in parts of Andhra Pradesh the price he had to pay was eight
years’ rent, which was roughly 40 per cent of the market price of the land. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>It needs to be added here that while
attempting to improve the condition of the tenants, tenancy legislation in
India by and large sought to maintain a balance between the interest of the
landowner, particularly the small landowner and the tenant. The absentee
landowners’ right of resumption of land for ‘personal cultivation’, which was
granted in most parts of India, as well as the tenants’ right to acquire the
lands they cultivated, was operated through a complex and variable system of
‘floors’ and ‘ceilings’ keeping this balance in view. The landowners’ right of
resumption was limited (this was aimed at the large landowners) to his total
holding after resumption not exceeding a certain limit or ceiling prescribed by
each state. The First Plan suggested a limit of three times the ‘family
holding’. A family holding inter-alia was defined as a single plough unit.
Also, while resuming land the landowner could not deprive the tenant of his
entire lands. In some states like Kerala, Orissa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the tenant had to be left with at least
half his holding. In some other states like Bihar the floor was half the
holding of the tenant or a minimum of five acres (in West Bengal two and a half
acres), whichever was less. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Conversely (and this was aimed at the
small landowner), the tenants’ right to acquire the landowner’s lands was
restricted by the condition that the landowner was not to be deprived of all his
lands and that the tenants’ holding after acquisition was not to exceed the
ceiling prescribed by each state. It was recognized, as the Second Plan noted
that, ‘The economic circumstances of small owners are not so different from
those <span class=0Text>137</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>of tenants that tenancy legislation
should operate to their disadvantage.’ The Plan therefore envisaged that very
small landowners could resume their entire holding for self-cultivation.
However, the actual experience of implementation of the tenancy laws was more complicated.
As P.S. Appu, who headed the Planning Commission Task Force on Agrarian
Relations (which reported in 1973) noted, the provisions introduced to protect
the small landowners were misused by the larger landlords with the active
connivance of the revenue officials.4 The Third Plan also pointed out the abuse
of such provisions by large landowners transferring their lands in names of a
number of relatives and others so as to enter the category of ‘small landowner’
and then evicting tenants from such lands by exercising the right of resumption
given to small owners. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In fact, the right of resumption and the
loose definition of ‘personal cultivation’ referred to earlier (initially only
Manipur and Tripura made personal labour by the landowner a condition of
resumption for personal cultivation) was used for eviction of tenants on a
massive scale. The process of eviction had actually begun in anticipation of
the imminent tenancy legislations. The inordinate delays in enacting and
implementing the legislations were engineered by vested interests enabling them
to evict potential beneficiaries before the law came into force. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Even after the tenants got legal
protection against eviction, large-scale evictions occurred. For example, the
Planning Commission’s Panel on Land Reforms noted in 1956 that between 1948 and
1951 the number of protected tenants in the State of Bombay declined from 1.7
million to 1.3 million, i.e., by more than 23 per cent; in the State of
Hyderabad between 1951 and 1955 the number declined by about 57 per cent.
Another detailed study of Hyderabad showed that out of every 100 protected
tenants created in 1951, after four years, i.e., by 1954, only 45.4 per cent
maintained that status; 12.4 per cent became landowners by exercising their
right to acquire land; 2.6 per cent were legally evicted; 22.1 per cent were
illegally evicted and 17.5 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>per cent ‘voluntarily’ surrendered their
claims to the land. Voluntary surrenders by tenants was really an euphemism for
illegal eviction as most often the tenant was ‘persuaded’ under threat to give
up his tenancy rights ‘voluntarily’. So common was the practice that the Fourth
Plan was constrained to recommend that all surrenders should only be in favour
of the government, which could allot such lands to eligible persons. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, only a handful of states acted
upon this recommendation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Before proceeding further on the failures
of tenancy legislation in providing security of tenure to a large section of
tenants, it is extremely important to also recognize that a substantial
proportion of tenants did acquire security and permanent occupancy rights. The
detailed study of Hyderabad referred to in the previous paragraph after all
shows that 45.4 per cent of the tenants remained protected tenants and 12.4 per
cent became owners, i.e., in sum about 67.8 per cent of the tenants brought
under the legislation no longer suffered from insecurity. This was an important
development with ramifications on levels of investment and improvement in
productivity in the lands of such ‘secure’ tenant cultivators. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In many cases tenancy legislations led to
tenancy being pushed underground, i.e., it continued in a concealed form. The
tenants were now called ‘farm servants’ though they continued in exactly the
same status. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In the early years of land reform,
tenants were often converted to sharecroppers, as surprisingly the latter were
not treated as tenants and therefore were not protected under the existing
tenancy legislation in some states such as in U.P. Only cash rent payers were
treated as tenants and not those who paid fixed produce rents or those who paid
a proportion of total produce as rent, i.e., sharecroppers. In West Bengal the
sharecroppers, known as bargadars, received no protection till as late as July
1970 when the West Bengal Land Reforms Act was amended to accord limited
protection to them. A spurt in the practice of share-cropping in the immediate
years after 1951 can partially be explained due to this factor, that
sharecroppers had no tenancy rights. Perhaps what contributed most to the
insecurity of tenants, was the fact that most tenancies were oral and informal,
i.e., they were not recorded and the tenants therefore could not benefit from
the legislation in their favour. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, going only by the recorded
tenancies the 1971 Census reached absurd conclusions such as that 91.1 per cent
of cultivated area in India was owner-operated and that Bihar had the largest
percentage of area under owner cultivation for, any state, i.e., 99.6 per cent
and that in Bihar tenancies constituted only 0.22 per cent of operational
holdings and 0.17 per cent of total cultivated area! This, when it is commonly <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>accepted that Bihar had a very high
proportion of tenancy, the 1961 Census quoting a figure of 36.65 per cent. The
discrepancy between the 1961 and 1971 Census figures would suggest that the
overwhelming majority of the tenancies were unrecorded and consequently the
tenants remained insecure. The 1961 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Census estimated that 82 per cent of the
tenancies in the country were insecure! The absence of proper records, for
example, was seen as a major impediment in the implementation of the Zamindari Abolition
and Land Reform Act in U.P. in the initial years after independence. A massive
drive had to be launched by Charan Singh, the then revenue minister to get a
few million records corrected or newly inscribed. In later years, in certain
areas, other such drives were launched, often under the hegemony of left
forces, and the targeted beneficiaries were no longer only the upper and middle
tenantry but also the poor, totally insecure and unprotected sharecroppers and
tenants at will. Some celebrated examples of such efforts were seen in Kerala
and West Bengal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In the late sixties a massive programme
of conferment of titles to lands to hutment dwellers and tenants was undertaken
in Kerala. The programme, which achieved considerable success, was launched with
the active participation of peasant organizations. The Left Front government in
West Bengal which came to power in June 1977 launched the famous Operation
Barga in July 1978 with the objective of, in a time-bound period, achieving the
registration of the sharecroppers, so that they could then proceed to secure
for them their legal rights, namely, permanent occupancy and heritable rights
and a crop division of 1:3 between landowner and sharecropper. Out of an
estimated 2.4 million bargadars in West Bengal only 0.4 million were recorded
till June 1978. However, after the launching of Operation Barga the number of
those recorded rose from 0.7 million by October 1979 to about 1.4 million by
November 1990. A significant aspect of the Operation Barga experiment in West
Bengal was that, like in Kerala, an effort was made to mobilize the support of
the rural poor and especially the targeted beneficiaries (the bargadars) and
their active participation was sought in the implementation of the reform
measures. This went a long way in neutralizing the lower level revenue
officials like patwaris, etc. who often acted as major impediments in the
successful implementation of government programmes. An innovative move of the
West Bengal government aimed at both giving a voice to the rural poor and
changing the attitude of the revenue officials was to start a number of
orientation camps while launching Operation Barga, ‘where 30 to 40 agricultural
workers and sharecroppers and a dozen and a half officers of Land Reform and other
related departments were made to stay together, eat together and discuss
together in the same premises in distant rural areas.’ Though Operation Barga
did lead to recording of a large number of sharecroppers and consequently
providing them with security of tenure, the process could not be completed and
it reached more or less a stalemate after a little more than half the
sharecroppers had been covered. This was because of some significant reasons.
First, it was found politically unviable, just as it was ethically
indefensible, to proceed with Operation Barga when faced with </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘landlords’ who themselves were
cultivators with holdings only marginally larger, if even that, than that of
the sharecroppers; landlords who were entitled to only one-fourth of the produce,
the rest being the sharecroppers’ share. As it has been noted that in West
Bengal where over time the overwhelming majority of the cultivators were small
cultivators controlling less than five acres, a further redistributive thrust
was difficult. ‘The “class enemy” had dissolved into a sea of small holdings.’7
The dilemma was the same as the one that was faced in other parts of India,
i.e., the need to balance the interest of the small landowner and the tenant.
As mentioned before, tenancy legislation in India generally anticipated this
aspect and had provisos built into the legislation which addressed the problem.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The other problem was that such was the
land-man ratio in Bengal that the landlord was often able to ro-tate a piece of
leased land among two or more sharecroppers or bargadars, i.e., for each piece
of land there could be more than one bargadar claiming tenancy rights.
Registering any one would permanently oust the other. Also, if all the
bargadars were registered in such a situation the size of the holdings per
cultivator would threaten to go way below the optimum. There were, thus,
political and economic limits to how far Operation Barga could be carried; the
objective situation did not permit the full implementation of the notion of ‘land
to the tiller’ or even the provision of full security of tenure to each
cultivator. </span></p>

legislation in India, that of providing security of tenure to all tenants met
with only limited success. While a substantial proportion of tenants did
acquire security (many even became landowners, as we shall see presently) there
were still large numbers who remained unprotected. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The partial success stories such as those
of Kerala and West Bengal notwithstanding, the practice of un-secured tenancy,
mostly oral, whether taking the form of share-cropping or the payment of fixed
produce or cash rent, continued in India on a large scale. It is the continued
existence of large number of insecure tenants which, inter-alia, made the
successful implementation of the second major objective of tenancy legislation
that of reducing rents to a ‘fair’ level, almost impossible to achieve. The
market condition, e.g., the adverse land-man ratio that developed in India
during colonial rule, pushed towards high rents. Legal ‘fair’ </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Legislation was enacted in all the states
regulating the rent payable by cultivating tenants. Most states fixed maximum
rents at levels suggested by the First and Second Plan, i.e. to 20 to 25 per

rent almost in all parts of the country tended to be around 50 per cent of
gross produce. In addition the tenant often ended up bearing the cost of the
production inputs either fully or to a substantial extent. Further, the Green
Revolution which started in some parts of India in the late sixties aggravated
the problems with land values and rentals rising further and reaching, for
example, in parts of Punjab, rates as high as 70 per cent. What made matters
worse was the fact that it was only the poor insecure tenants or sharecroppers
who paid the market rates of rent. Only the upper stratum of the tenantry,
which had secured occupancy rights, and was often indistinguishable from a
landowner, was able to enforce the payment of legal rates of rent. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>As for the third objective of tenancy
legislation in India, i.e., the acquisition of ownership rights by tenants,
this too was achieved only partially. As we saw above, in some detail, the use
of the right to resumption by landowners, legal and illegal evictions,
‘voluntary’ surrenders, shift to oral and or concealed tenancy, etc., eroded
the possibility of achieving this objective adequately. Yet, it must be noted
quite a substantial number of tenants did acquire ownership rights. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Unfortunately, detailed data on this
aspect for the whole country is not available. However, certain case studies of
specific regions may serve as an indicator. P.S. Appu wrote in 1975 that,
according to ‘latest information’, in Gujarat out of about 1.3 million tenants
ownership rights had been purchased by more than half, namely about 0.77
million; and in Maharashtra out of 2.6 million tenants, again about half,
namely, 1.1 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

other states, too, a substantial number of tenants did become owners, their
numbers adding up to a few million. (It must be remembered that this is in
addition to the 20 million odd tenants who became landowners as a result of the
abolition of intermediaries in zamindari areas). It has been argued that one
reason why even a larger number of tenants did not acquire ownership rights was
that for a large number of tenants who had acquired permanent occupancy rights
and achieved rent reduction, there was hardly any motivation to try and acquire
full ownership which would involve not only raising capital (albeit only a
fraction of the market value of land) but legal and other complications. </span></p>

zamindari, tenancy legislation and ceiling legislation (see the next chapter
for a detailed discussion of land ceiling) in the direction of meeting one of
the major objective of land reform, i.e., creation of progressive cultivators
making investments and improvement in productivity, was considerable. A very
perceptive observer of India’s land reforms, the economist, Daniel Thorner had
noted, as early as 1968, that despite all the evasions, leakages, loopholes,
and so on, ‘many millions of cultivators who had previously been weak tenants or
tenants-at-will were enabled to become superior tenants or virtual owners.’</span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>If one lists certain changes together,
the cumulative impact can be easily ascertained. Abolition of zamindari led to
about 20 million tenants, the superior occupancy tenants, becoming landowners
and many absentee zamindars actually turning to direct cultivation in the lands
‘resumed’ for ‘personal’ cultivation. In the ryotwari areas nearly half the
tenants, e.g., in Bombay and Gujarat become landowners. Further, about half (in
Bombay about 70 per cent) of the lands from which tenants were evicted were
used by the landowners for direct cultivation, i.e., they were not leased out
again in a concealed manner. Also, a very substantial number of inferior
tenants in</span></p>

rights (about half in Gujarat and Maharashtra). Even in former zamindari areas
such as West Bengal, nearly half the sharecroppers got occupancy rights. To
this may be added between three to five million landless cultivators who got land
which was declared surplus under ceiling laws. </span></p>

on their own resources or on credit from institutional sources which became

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>A major plank of the land reform effort
in India was the imposition of ceilings on the size of landholdings, with the
objective of making land distribution more equitable. On this question,
however, societal consensus was weak, if not non-existent, and that was
reflected in the extreme difficulty in implementing this programme with even a
reasonable degree of success. The All India Kisan Sabha had supported the
demand for a maximum limit of landownership of 25 acres per landholder in 1946.
The Congress, perhaps for the first time, officially introduced the notion of
land ceiling soon after independence. In November 1947, the AICC </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>appointed a committee, which drew up the
economic programme of the Congress. The committee headed by Jawaharlal Nehru
had recommended, ‘The maximum size of holdings should be fixed. The surplus
land over such a maximum should be acquired and placed at the disposal of the
village cooperatives.’ Similarly, the Congress Agrarian Reform Committee,
chaired by J.C. Kumarappa, which submitted its report in July 1949, also
recommended a ceiling on landholding which was to be three times the size of an
economic holding. (An economic holding being defined as that which would give a
reasonable standard of living to the cultivator and provide full employment to
a family of normal size and at least to a pair of bullocks.) The First Plan
(1951-1956) too expressed itself ‘in favour of the principle that there should
be an upper limit to the amount of land that an individual may hold.’ Though
the Plan broadly accepted the upper limit suggested by the Kumarappa Committee
as ‘fair’, it was nevertheless stated that the exact upper limit was to be
‘fixed by each State, having regard to its own agrarian history and its present
problems.’ Moreover, it was stated, ‘The census of land holding and
cultivation, which it is proposed to hold during 1953, will give the data
relevant to this decision.’ Clearly, there was no immediate programme of
implementing ceilings and the First Plan anticipated that ‘two to three years
would be necessary’ to even undertake the necessary survey and set up a
machinery which would enforce ceiling legislation effectively. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>It was a matter of no surprise,
therefore, that despite the early statements of intentions and recommendations,
not much progress on the question of ceilings occurred in the initial years
after independence. This was recognized by the Congress, and the AICC in its
session in Agra in 1953 urged, ‘The State Governments should take immediate steps
in regard to collection of requisite land data and the fixation of ceilings on
land holdings, with a view to redistribute the land, as far as possible, among
landless workers.’ This position was reiterated repeatedly by the Congress
Working Committee and the AICC over the next few years. In 1957 </span></p>

Development Council (The NDC was created in 1952. It was a forum where all the
chief ministers of the states would assemble, under the chairmanship of Nehru,
to discuss critical issues relating to development) adopted a decision to
complete the imposition of ceilings in the few states where such legislation
had been passed by the end of 1960 and decided that other states should pass
such legislation by 1958-59. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In the meantime, opposition to ceilings
was building up in large parts of the country, in the Press, in parliament, in
the state legislatures and even within the Congress party. A threat to the
right to private property was perceived by the rural landowners as well as
urban interests. Matters came to a head at the Nagpur session of the Indian
National Congress in January 1959. Despite opposition from prominent
Congressmen at the AICC and the Subjects Committee meeting preceding the open
session, the Nagpur Congress (January 1959) passed a resolution stating that
‘in order to remove uncertainty regarding land reforms and give stability to
the farmer, ceilings should be fixed on existing and future holdings and
legislation to this effect </span></p>

the end of 1959.’ Further, the land declared surplus, i.e., above ceiling
limits, was to ‘vest in the panchayats … and (be) managed through cooperatives
consisting of landless labourers.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>A wave of criticism was to follow in the
months following the Nagpur session. N.G. Ranga, Secretary of the Congress
parliamentary party who had already, in December 1958, sent to Nehru a letter
signed by a hundred Congress members of parliament, critiquing the idea of
ceilings, resigned from the Congress in February 1959. The Nagpur Resolution
contributed considerably towards the consolidation of the right-wing forces
both in the rural and urban sectors of the country. N.G. Ranga and C.
Rajagopalachari, alarmed at the moves towards land ceilings and threats of compulsory
cooperativization now joined hands with Minoo Masani an important leader of the
Forum for Free Enterprise which campaigned against the threat of
nationalization and the public sector swamping the private sector, to form the
Swatantra party in June 1959, with Ranga as a president. The campaigners and
beneficiaries of zamindari abolition, the tenants who had now become
landowners, also ranged themselves against the next step in land reform, an
attempt at redistribution of land ownership through imposition of land
ceilings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The opponents of the ceilings legislation
were, however, to have their real victory at the state level, as it was the
states which had to formulate and implement the legislation. The state
legislatures, which met shortly after the Nagpur session, showed no haste in
implementing the Nagpur Resolution. The ceilings issue thus dragged on and most
states passed the enabling legislation only by the end of 1961, i.e., nearly
fourteen years after the idea was officially mooted. </span></p>

<p class=Para1 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Weaknesses in Land Ceiling Legislation</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The long delay, as well as the nature of
the legislation, ensured that the ceilings would have a very muted impact,
releasing little surplus land for redistribution. By and large the ceiling laws
in most states had certain major shortcomings. First, in a situation where more
than 70 per cent of land holdings in India were under five acres, the ceiling
fixed on existing holdings by the states were very high. For example, in Andhra
Pradesh, it varied from 27 to 312 acres (depending upon the class of land),
Assam 50 acres, Kerala 15 to 37.5 acres, Punjab 30 to 60 acres, West Bengal 25
acres, Maharashtra 18 to 126 acres and so on. Moreover, in most states,
initially, the ceilings were imposed on individuals and not family holdings, enabling
landowners to divide up their holdings ‘notionally’ in the names of relatives
merely to avoid the ceiling. Further, in many states the ceiling could be
raised, e.g., by 67 per cent in Kerala, 90 per cent in Madhya Pradesh, 100 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>per cent in Bihar, Madras and
Maharashtra, 140 per cent in Tripura and so on, if the size of the family of
the landholder exceeded five. Andhra Pradesh had no limit, allowing 6 to 72
acres (depending on the nature of land) per ‘extra’ member of the family. Very
few landed families would have holdings that exceeded these liberal limits.
Only in some states, where very few holdings exceeded the ceiling limit such as
Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, no allowance was
made for the size of the family. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Second, a large number of exemptions to
the ceiling limits were permitted by most states following the Second Plan
recommendations that certain categories of land could be exempted from
ceilings. These were tea, coffee and rubber plantations, orchards, specialized
farms engaged in cattle breeding, dairying, wool raising, etc., sugarcane farms
operated by sugar factories and efficiently managed farms on which heavy
investments had been made. The intention was clearly to promote and certainly
not hinder progressive or capitalist farming done on a large scale, while at
the same time ending absentee landlordism indulged in by large landowners
through tenants and sharecroppers. </span></p>

<p class=Para1 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>142</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, the exemptions were often
carried to absurd limits with Tamil Nadu reportedly permitting 26 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>kinds of exemptions. In any case,
criteria such as ‘efficiently managed farm’ were sufficiently vague for large
number of landholders to evade the ceilings by simply getting themselves
declared ‘efficient’. Similarly, exemption to land held by cooperatives, as
proposed by the Madras government, was open to great misuse with landlords
transferring their lands to bogus cooperatives. On the other hand, however, the
ceiling laws led to at least some landowners shifting to direct ‘efficient’
farming in order to avoid alienation of their lands. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Finally, the long delay in bringing in
ceiling legislation to a large extent defeated its purpose. The large
landowners had enough time to either sell their excess lands, or make malafide
transfers in the names of relatives and even make benami transfers. Further,
the landowners also resorted to mass eviction of tenants, resuming their lands
at least upto the ceiling limit, and claiming, often falsely, to have shifted
to progressive farming under their direct supervision. Thus, by the time the
ceiling legislations were in place, there were barely any holdings left above
the ceiling and consequently little surplus land became available for
redistribution. This was recognized by the Congress leadership and the Third
Plan also admitted it. In fact, despite the ceiling legislations which were
passed by most states by 1961, till the end of 1970 not a single acre was
declared surplus in large states like Bihar, Mysore, Kerala, Orissa and
Rajasthan. In Andhra Pradesh, a mere 1400 acres were declared surplus but no
land was distributed. Only in Jammu and Kashmir were ceiling laws fully
implemented and by the middle of 1955 about 230,000 acres of surplus land were
handed over to tenants and landless labourers, that too without having to pay
any compensation. However, taking India as whole, only 2.4 million acres were
declared surplus by the end of 1970, and the area distributed constituted only
about half the surplus land, constituting a mere 0.3 per cent of the total
cultivated land of India. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The dismal record in using ceiling
legislation for a more equitable distribution of land combined with a sharply
increasing polarization in the countryside since the mid-sixties called for a
new initiative in land reform. The Indian countryside saw the growing
consolidation of the owner cultivator/rich peasant interests and their finding
a distinct political voice in formations such as the BKD (formed by Charan
Singh after he brought down the C.B. Gupta-led Congress government in U.P. in
1967). The BKD later merged with Swatantra and other parties to become BLD in
1974 and the BLD was the principal component of the Janata Party which came to
power in 1977, after the Emergency, bringing the strong influence, of the owner

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In the wake of the political and economic
crisis of the mid-sixties, inflation, devaluation, the Indo-Pak war, and so on,
there emerged a strong strand of agrarian radicalism in large parts of the
country. The Naxalite Movement led by the CPI (ML) peaked in West Bengal and
parts of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar towards the end of the sixties. The
year 1970, and in some cases like in West Bengal the preceding few years, saw a
widespread ‘land grab’ movement by the landless in many parts of the country
under the leadership of the Communist and Socialist parties. Disturbances were
reported from Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil
Nadu, U.P., and West Bengal in 1969-70. The total amount of land seized was not
very significant and most of it was government wasteland, land taken over by
the government but not distributed, and to some extent homestead land. The
movement was effectively suppressed. About 20,000 political activists were
arrested. However, despite the very limited success in land seizure and the
quick suppression of the movement, on the whole the movement had a significant
symbolic effect. The nation’s attention was drawn dramatically to the agrarian
question. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>This was the context in which the second
spurt of land reform efforts was to occur in the sixties and early seventies.
The Land Reform Implementation Committee of the National Development Council
met in June 1964 and made sustained efforts to put pressure on the chief
ministers to plug the loopholes in the land reform legislations and implement
them effectively. With the political shift of Indira Gandhi to the left in the
late sixties, particularly after 1969, these efforts received a further
momentum. At a land reform conference of the chief ministers called by her in
September 1970, she forcefully argued that social discontent and violence in
the countryside had erupted because:</span></p>

failed to match the legitimate expectations which were first fostered among
millions of cultivators during the national movement … In short, we have yet to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Reduction of ceiling limits was one of
the main issues discussed in the Conference with most of the chief ministers
rejecting such a proposal outright. The matter was referred to the Central Land
Reforms Committee, which was to look into this and other contentious issues
that emerged in the Conference. In August 1971, the Committee made a series of
recommendations including a substantial reduction in the ceiling limits,
withdrawal of exemptions such as those in favour of ‘efficient’ or mechanized
farms and making ceilings applicable to the family as a unit and not to
individuals as was the case in most states. </span></p>

after the electoral victories of 1971 and 1972, was able to get the chief
ministers’ conference held in July 1972 to approve new national guidelines
following months of bitter opposition. The new guidelines were based
essentially on the August 1971 recommendations of the Central Land Reforms
Committee. Some of the important features of the July 1972 guidelines, which
marked a break in the history of ceiling legislation in India, were: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>&#61607; The ceiling for double-cropped

it was twenty-seven acres for single cropped land and fifty-four acres for
inferior dry lands. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>&#61607; A ceiling was to be applicable
to a family as a unit of five members, (husband, wife and three minor
children). Additional land per additional member could be permitted for
families which exceeded this number but up to a maximum limit of double the
ceiling for the five member unit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>&#61607; In the distribution of surplus

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Following the 1972 guidelines most states
(barring some north-eastern states and Goa which had no ceiling laws) passed
revised ceiling legislation, lowering the ceiling limits within the range

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>A common method was to seek judicial
intervention on a number of grounds. Hundreds of thousands of ceiling cases

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In an attempt to stem this menace the
government got the 34th Amendment to the Constitution passed in parliament in
August 1974, getting most of the revised ceiling laws included in the Ninth
Schedule of the Constitution so that they could not be challenged on
constitutional grounds. While the renewed effort of the seventies did lead to
some progress in surplus land being redistributed, the overall results were
still far from satisfactory. As a result of the ceiling laws of the seventies,
an additional area of about 2.27 million acres of land was distributed by the
early eighties, but, quite symptomatic of the entire effort at ceiling reform,
an estimated 32.25 million acres of land was willfully dispersed to avoid
ceilings. Nevertheless, by March 1985, 7.2 million acres were declared surplus
out of which 4.3 million acres were distributed to about 3.3 million
beneficiaries. Moreover, more than half, 54.6 per cent of the beneficiaries
were members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who received about
43.6 per cent of the area distributed. The objective set out in the 1947
economic programme of the Congress, of distributing surplus lands to village
cooperatives or of even using such lands to start new cooperatives did not
achieve any success. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Out of the land declared surplus but not
distributed, nearly 1.6 million acres was under litigation. There was wide
regional variation in the implementation of ceiling laws, with the states,
where greater political mobilization of the targeted beneficiaries occurred, or
where greater political will was shown by the government, achieving a much
higher levels of success. For example, it is estimated that West Bengal, which <span

cultivated area in India, contributed about a quarter of the total land
declared surplus under ceiling laws all over India. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>By the middle of 1992, the area declared
surplus was 7.3 million acres (it was 2.4 million acres in 1970) and the area
distributed was about 5 million acres (it was 1.2 million acres in 1970) and
the beneficiaries numbered about 4.7 million. The increase in the number of
beneficiaries particularly between 1985 and 1992 was far greater than the rise
in area distributed, 1.4 million beneficiaries and 0.1 million acres
respectively. This suggests that the new beneficiaries would be receiving only
tiny plots or homestead lands. </span></p>

improvement after 1972, yet, the total area declared surplus that could be
distributed among the landless constituted only about 2 per cent of the
cultivated area. Again, while it is true that more than four and a half million
people, mostly landless, did receive some land (however poor its quality and
however small the size of the holding), the inequities in Indian agriculture,
which the ceiling laws were intended to address, persisted to a very large
extent. An important impact of the ceiling laws, and perhaps in the long run
the most critical one, was that it killed the land market and prevented an
increasing concentration in landholdings through de-peasantisation. As the
eminent scholar of Indian agriculture and policy-maker, C.H. Hanumantha Rao,
put it, ‘The law discouraged concentration of landownership beyond the ceiling
level and thus prevented the possible dispossession of numerous small and
marginal holders which would probably have occurred through a competitive
process in the land market in the absence of a ceiling on landholdings.’</span></p>

large areas of surplus lands for redistribution was missed because of defective
and delayed ceiling laws, in the long run the high population growth and the
rapid subdivision of large holdings over several generations (in the absence of
the practice of primogeniture for inheritance in India) led automatically to
little land remaining over the ceiling limits. In fact, the number of holdings
and the area operated under the category of large holdings, 25 acres or above
(even 15 acres and above) kept falling in the decades since independence right
upto the nineties. Except in certain small pockets in the country, very large
landholdings of the semi-feudal type are now things of the past. Inequality
among landowners was no longer a key issue, as landholding was not very skewed
any more. By one estimate, by 1976-77 nearly 97 per cent of the operated
holdings were below 25 acres and 87 per cent of the holdings were below 10
acres. The problem of the landless or the near landless, who it is estimated
constituted nearly half the agricultural population still required urgent
attention. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, any further attempt at land
redistribution through lowering of ceilings does not appear to be politically
feasible or even economically viable. Given the adverse land-man ratio in India
and particularly given (unlike many other countries with similar ratios) the
fact that a very high proportion of the population continues to be dependent on
agriculture (nearly 67 per cent of the total workforce was engaged in agriculture
in 1991) and that consequently the number of potential competitors for land is
very large, any attempt to further reduce ceilings to provide land for the
landless labourers would vastly increase the number of uneconomic and unviable
holdings. Also, it would range the entire, now politically very important,
landowning classes, powerfully mobilized under the ‘new’ farmers’ movement,
against any regime which tried to do so. As an eminent radical journalist said
to us recently, ‘Only a Pol Pot can try to do land redistribution on the basis
of land to the tiller today.’</span></p>

for the landless was the one which has been to some extent taken up in recent

off-farm employment in rural areas, in increasing animal husbandry and other
activities associated with cultivation but not requiring land. </span></p>

implement land reforms by urging the landed classes to voluntarily surrender a
part of their land to the landless. The Bhoodan was started in 1951. The
problems faced by the landless harijans were presented to Vinoba Bhave in
Pochampalli, Telangana. </span></p>

some land owing class agreed to voluntary donation of their some part of land.
This led to the birth of Bhoodan Movement. Central and State governments had
provided the necessary assistance to Vinoba Bhave. Later, Bhoodan gave way to
the Gramdan movement which began in 1952. The objective of the Gramdan movement
was to persuade landowners and leaseholders in each village to renounce their
land rights and all the lands would become the property of a village
association for egalitarian redistribution and joint cultivation. A village is
declared as Gramdan when at least 75 per cent of its residents with 51 per cent
of the land signify their approval in writing for Gramdan. The first village to
come under Gramdan, was Magroth, Haripur, Uttar Pradesh. </span></p>

movement to a government supported programme. In 1967, after the withdrawal of
Vinoba Bhave from the movement, it lost its mass base. In the later period,
landlords had mostly donated land under dispute or unfit for cultivation. The
whole movement was treated as something different from the general scheme of
development rather than combining with the existing institutional means. This
separation from the mainstream scheme seriously affected its continuation as a
policy. </span></p>

massive popular struggles from the twenties onwards opened up new vistas of
possibilities that a century of social reform could not. The image of the woman
changed from a recipient of justice in the nineteenth century, to an ardent
supporter of nationalist men in the early twentieth, to a comrade by the
thirties and forties. Women had participated in all streams of the national
movement—from Gandhian to Socialist to Communist to revolutionary terrorist.
They had been in peasant movements and in trade union struggles. They had
founded separate women’s organizations as well; the All India Women’s
Conference, founded in 1926, being the most important of these. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>After independence, when the time came to
consolidate the gains of the hard-fought struggle, the attention naturally
turned to securing legal and constitutional rights. The Constitution promised
complete equality to women. It fulfilled the promise made many years ago by the
national movement: women got the vote, along with men, without any
qualification of education or property or income. A right for which women
suffragettes fought long and hard in many western countries was won at one
stroke by Indian women! In the early fifties, Nehru initiated the process of
the enactment of the Hindu Code Bill, a measure demanded <span class=0Text>146</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

under the Chairmanship of B.N. Rau, the constitutional expert who prepared the
first draft of the Constitution of India, had already gone into the matter and
submitted a draft code in 1944. Another committee, chaired by B.R. Ambedkar,
the law minister after independence, submitted a bill which raised the age of
consent and marriage, upheld monogamy, gave women the rights to divorce,
maintenance and inheritance, and treated dowry as stridhan, or women’s property.
Strong opposition from conservative sections of society, and hesitation on the
part of some senior Congress leaders, including President Rajendra Prasad, led
to the bill being postponed, despite strong support from a majority of
Congressmen and from women activists and social reformers. Ultimately, sections
of the bill were passed as four separate acts:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Hindu Marriage Act, the Hindu
Succession Act, the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and the Hindu Adoption
and Maintenance Act. The extension of legal rights to Hindu women was not
sufficient but it was a big step forward. This is seen from the stiff
opposition encountered by the government in its attempts to extend legal rights
in the case of other religious communities. The Shah Bano case is a good
example. In 1985, about forty years after Hindu law was reformed, the Supreme
Court granted a pittance as maintenance to Shah Bano, a divorced Muslim woman.
There was a furore among the conservative Muslim sections and sufficient
pressure was put on the Rajiv Gandhi government for it to wilt and introduce a
bill to negate the Supreme Court judgement. It is no doubt easy and even
necessary to castigate the government for its cowardice but it should be
remembered that while the Opposition brought lakhs into the streets, the
supporters of Shah Bano could muster only hundreds. While criticizing Nehru for
not pushing through a more radical civil code for Hindus and for not passing a
uniform civil code applicable to all citizens, it should be remembered that
while Nehru did face opposition, he could also muster considerable support
because among Hindus the process of social reform had gone much further than
among Muslims, as evidenced by the Shah Bano case thirty years later. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>While some legal rights have been
exercised, others have remained on paper. The right to vote has been taken very
seriously and women are keen voters, acutely conscious of the power of the
vote. This is particularly true of rural women. But in other respects,
especially with regard to right to inheritance of parental property, legal
rights are by and large not claimed. It is still common in most parts of the
country for women, both rural and urban, to forgo their rights in parental
property. The custom of partilocal residence (residence in husband’s home) is
very largely responsible for this. This is also one reason women have refused
to give up dowry because it is their only chance of getting a share of their
parental property. The legal right to divorce has been increasingly used in urban
areas, though the stigma attached to divorce is still prevalent, and the
difficulties of setting-up as a single woman immense. </span></p>

the mass migration and riots accompanying Partition, setting up working women’s
hostels in cities, and women’s vocational centres. In 1954, Communist women
left the All India Women’s Conference to form the National Federation of Indian
Women, which became, a party forum and not a broad united platform for women.
Perhaps inevitably, there was not much evidence of women’s ‘struggles’ in the
fifties and sixties, which led to a view that there was no women’s movement
after independence till the new initiative in the seventies. But such a
perception fails to comprehend the inevitable phases of consolidation and quiet
constructive work that follow phases of intense struggles as being integral
parts of the movement. The Indian women’s movement went through precisely such
a phase after independence. </span></p>

in peasant, tribal, farmers’, trade union and environment movements and this
has also enabled them to raise women’s issues within them. In the Tebhaga
peasant movement in Bengal in 1946-47, women had organized themselves on a
separate platform of the Nari Bahini and they ran shelters and maintained lines
of communication. Communist women activists also mobilized rural women on
specifically women’s issues such as rights to finance and property, and
village-level Mahila Atma Raksha Samitis (women’s self-defence committees) were
formed which also took up the issue of domestic violence or wife-beating. In
another major Communist peasant struggle of that time in the Telangana area of
Hyderabad State from 1946-1950, women’s participation was also quite
significant, and the leadership did pay attention to women’s issues such as
wife-beating. But there is no evidence of women’s organizations emerging. It is
also said that women were discouraged from joining the guerilla force and, when
they did succeed in joining, felt they were not totally accepted. Communist
women in other areas also complained later that they were strongly encouraged
to marry men comrades and edged into working on the ‘women’s front’, radier
than integrated into the leadership as members in their own right. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In the late sixties and early seventies,
there was a new political ferment in the country which gave rise to a host of
new political trends and movements, such as the Naxalite movement, the JP
movement, the Chipko movement, and the anti-price rise movement. In the
anti-price rise movement of 1973-75, which was organized by Communist and
Socialist women in the urban areas of Maharashtra, thousands of housewives joined
in public rallies and those who could not leave their houses joined by beating <span

pins). The movement spread to Gujarat where it meshed into the Nav Nirman
movement influenced by Jayaprakash Narayan’s ‘Total Revolution’. Though neither
of these directly addressed what are called women’s issues, the very fact of
mass participation of women had a liberating effect and enabled women to gain
the self-confidence needed for moving on to more complex issues of patriarchy
and women’s oppression. Meanwhile, in Gujarat, a very important new development
was the founding of a women’s wing of the Textile Labour Association (TLA), an
old Gandhian organization, called SEWA or Self-Employed Women’s Association,
which eventually became independent of the TLA. It was unique in that it took
up women in the unorganized sector who worked as vendors and hawkers and at
home in the putting-out system and organized them into a union which along with
collective bargaining provided training, credit and technical help. SEWA spread
to Indore, Bhopal, Delhi and Lucknow and even today under the able leadership of
Ela Bhatt is among the top success stories of Indian women. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

movement for drought relief and land in which the Bhil tribal women were very
prominent culminated in a militant an-ti-liquor campaign in which women, who
saw liquor as the main cause of wife-beating, broke liquor pots in drinking
dens and marched to punish in public, men who beat their wives. In Uttarakhand,
in the hill areas of U.P. in the early sixties, a similar movement had taken
place under the influence of Gandhians such as Vinoba Bhave, Gandhiji’s
followers Sarla Behn and Mira Ben, who had set up ashrams in Kumaon after
independence, and the local Gandhian leader Sunderlal Bahuguna, who became
famous in the Chipko agitation. </span></p>

nurturing role towards nature, and that environment issues were very often
women’s issues because they suffered most from its deterioration, as when
forests disappeared and they had to walk for miles to collect fuelwood, fodder
and water. In Chattisgarh, women were very militant in the Chattisgarh Mines

Party, mostly Socialists, formed the Mahila Dakshata Samiti and played a major
role in initiating the campaign against dowry in which the Delhi-based Stri
Sangharsh was also very active. The issue of dowry harassment and dowry deaths
was taken up from 1979 in a big way through street rallies and plays,
demonstrations outside houses of dowry victims, and demands for legal reform.
The Janwadi Mahila Samiti, a wing of the CPM women’s wing, the All India
Democratic Women’s Association set up in 1981, conducted a door-to-door
campaign on the issue. A bill to amend the Dowry Prohibition Act (1961) was
sent to a Joint Select Committee of the parliament and throughout 1981 and

committee as it toured the country. </span></p>

against perpetrators of dowry-related crimes were passed in 1984; a few minor
ones followed later. The movement declined after this, leaving behind a feeling
that the victories have not meant much, given the persistence of dowry and
difficulty in securing convictions of offenders. The other major campaign issue
that emerged was rape, especially police rape. A number of cases, the Rameeza
Bee case in 1978 in Hyderabad, the Mathura case in Maharashtra and the Maya
Tyagi case in western U.P. in 1980, brought the whole issue to public
attention. Women’s groups and organizations, along with mainstream political
parties, took up the issue in a big way and a bill was introduced in 1980
itself to amend the existing law on rape. Passed in 1983, the main change that
it brought about was that custodial rape was treated as a more heinous crime
than other forms of rape and the burden of proof was shifted from the victim to
the accused and this made a sea change in the possibility of bringing about
convictions of offenders. The campaign had subsided in the meantime, having
shown up in its course the sharp divisions in the women’s movement, which were
caused as much by struggles over turf as by differences of ideology and
strategy. The prompt response of the government also left many activists
feeling that their agenda had been hijacked or ‘appropiated’ by the government.
The inherent weakness in a strategy that does not have room for absorbing
reformist gains was revealed starkly. </span></p>

women on to the streets to defend their right to sati. Interestingly, some of
the more effective opposition to sati came from Arya Samajists like Swami
Agnivesh, who toured the rural areas of Rajasthan and Haryana mobilizing
opinion against sati, and also challenged the head priests of the Puri and
Benares temples to a debate on their claim for a scriptural sanction for sati.
In Orissa, Gandhians organized a rally of 10,000 women to gherao the head
priest of the Fluri temple, challenging him to prove his claim, which he could
not. Opposition also came from the anti-caste movement in Maharashtra and rural
women in Rajasthan. Among the ‘autonomous’ women’s groups, by the eighties
there was a clear shift away from mass campaigns to less dramatic work such as
setting up of women’s centres for legal aid, counselling, documentation,
research, publication and the like, at least partly because it was felt that
the mass campaigns with their focus on legal reform had not really succeeded in
solving the problems they had set out to address. Many women’s groups such as
Saheli in Delhi felt it was important not only to focus on women’s problems but
also on their joys, and encouraged women to express themselves through music,
dance and art. Others brought out magazines, acted as watchdogs on the media
for scanning advertisements and films derogatory to women, raised issues
related to women’s health, or campaigned against foeticide, for the rights of
the girl child, or for water and housing for women in the slums. Many groups

university-based centres also came up in the nineties, and enough research and
writing was available for courses on Women’s Studies to begin to appear in
university curricula. Clearly, the movement had entered another phase of
institutionalisation and consolidation as it had in the early fifties, and what
appeared to some activists as a watering down of the movement was more likely
diffusion of its ideas into the wider society which was bound to be accompanied
by some dilution of its sharp ideological content. It is also true that the
movement suffered from a lack of unity about goals, strategies, and methods,
from sectarianism which was probably the contribution of the left, and a
tendency for reacting to immediate crises rather than building a consensus on
an agenda for action. It has also been alleged that some sections were swayed
by the money received from foreign organizations into taking up issues that
concerned the donors but had little relevance to the movement in India, and at
least some of the more convoluted debates on theoretical issues that absorbed
the energies of some feminists suggest that the charge is not without
substance. The gap between urban educated women’s groups and rural or poor
urban women’s concerns also remained, though it narrowed in some instances. </span></p>

in vain. Government policy was certainly affected, and it came up with a National
Perspective Plan for Women in 1988, which detailed plans for women’s health,
education and political participation. In 1989, the Panchayati Raj bill was
introduced (though it was passed only in 1993) which instituted one-third of
the seats in the panchayats to be reserved for women. The Scheme for
Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWACRA) was introduced which
sponsored Mahila Mandals or Sanghams in rural areas and it enabled many poor
women who had no other access to organize and express themselves, often helped
by local level voluntary groups and political activists. Another innovative
scheme called the Mahila Kosh was also started which extended credit to Mahila
Mandals to enable their members to improve their skills and standards of living.
The effectivity of these depended on the capacity of their utilization at the
local level, and this varied with the level of politicization and awareness <span

groups were able to use the legitimacy or protective cover of a government
scheme as a stepping stone to reach poor rural women whom otherwise they would
find difficult to touch. Attempts to increase women’s role in local and
national politics are still being made. Since one-third of the seats in the
panchayats are now reserved for women, women panchayat members and village
pradhans are now being given special training to perform their new roles. A
serious move to reserve one-third of the seats in parliament for women has been
going on for some time and has received considerable support from women
politicians and women’s groups and some political parties, and generated a
great deal of debate. </span></p>

glowing example. It would appear that it is unique because of the historical
advantage of having a very early start in the field of education, and because
of the matrilineal customs of a significant part of its population. While both
these advantages are a fact—the erstwhile princely states of Travancore and
Cochin which constitute the bulk of modem Kerala, did give a very strong
emphasis to education from the first quarter of the nineteenth century and the
matrilineal system, which includes matrilo-cal residence, inheritance through
females, etc. is a strong positive factor—other factors such as an activist and
participatory political culture, itself helped by high literacy levels, positive
public policies in the areas of health, public distribution system, and primary
education, have been extremely important. And these are replicable, as shown by
other success stories, notably Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. </span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The extreme diversity that we have
encountered enables us to analyse the factors that facilitate and inhibit
positive trends in gender justice. While history and tradition are important
and the south of the country, historically, has a better record than the north,
a strong commitment in public policy can bring about rapid change, as shown by
Himachal Pradesh. The diversity also shows that economic prosperity or growth
does not automatically lead to greater gender justice; Punjab, and even more
Haryana, two prosperous states, perform pretty poorly on the gender front. The
factors which facilitate improvement in women’s position also emerge quite
clearly. Female literacy and education are unambiguous winners, with the links
with improvement in all other indicators coming out very sharply. Conversely,
low literacy and education levels lead to negative trends in other indicators. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Women, therefore, have been the main
victims of India’s failures on the elementary education and literacy fronts.
When primary schools in villages do not function, boys are sent to neighbouring
villages or towns or even to private schools, but girls are usually just kept
at home. Social conservatism, combined with the notion that investing money in
a girl’s education is like watering a plant in another man’s house, since the
benefits will accrue to the girl’s in-laws’ family, lead to this decision. But
if schools are available, and teachers are regular, and classes are held, a
large proportion of girls do get sent to school in most parts of the country.
The consciousness of the value of education has spread to this extent even
among the poorest sections. In fact, the poor are more aware that education is
their one route to upward social mobility. But in a situation when
single-teacher schools accounted for one third of all schools (in 1986) and
where, as recent surveys have shown, two thirds of teachers were found to be
absent during inspections, where there are fifty-eight children for each
teacher at the 6-10 age group level, where India ranks 82nd in terms of the
proportion of public expenditure on education to GNP among 116 countries for
which data is available, it is small wonder that the rate of female literacy is
as low as 39 per cent (1990-91). Another factor that is very important in
improving gender justice is the provision of free primary health facilities at
the grassroots level. As in the case of education, if health facilities are not
easily accessible or are expensive, the loss is unequally that of women and
female children. In fact, unequal access to improved facilities as well as to
improved living standards is the major cause of the sharp decline in the
female-male ratio in India from 972 to 927 between 1901-1991. It is not that
the survival chances of women have decreased in absolute terms—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>on the contrary. But relative to men,
women have gained less from the improved access to health facilities and better
living standards and therefore their proportion has declined. To correct this
imbalance, health facilities have to be brought within the reach of women.
Where this has been done, as in Kerala, where over 90 per cent of women deliver
their babies in medical institutions, the results are dramatic. Thus, if the
legal and political rights granted to women in the Constitution, which are
theirs by virtue of their own efforts as well as by all norms of social
justice, are to be realized and democratized, millions of women have to become
capable of understanding and exercising them. Kerala, and Himachal, at two
poles of the country, have shown the way: the heartland has to follow. The
women’s movement also needs to incorporate education and health as priorities
into its strategy for women’s empowerment. </span></p>

spread to many parts of the country, especially West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar and

who often experienced discrimination and exploitation from state authorities.

manifesting itself through various civil society and front organizations on

of 1999 in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kargil district which was the part of Baltistan
district of Ladakh before the partition of India 1947 and was separated by the
LOC after the first Kashmir War (1947-1948). The conflict began in the winter
of early 1999, when Pakistan Army along with the Mujahideen reoccupied the
forward positions and strategic peaks of Kargil, Drass and Bata-lik. “<span
class=0Text>Operation Al-Badar</span>” was the name given to Pakistan’s
infiltration. Based on information from local shepherds, the Indian Army was
able to ascertain the points of incursion and deployed four divisions to take
back the strategic peaks for securing its main supply line in Kashmir. India’s
operation to recapture their territory was named “<span class=0Text>Operation
Vijay</span>“. The Pakistani soldiers had positioned themselves at higher
altitudes which gave them an advantage in combat, as they could fire down at
advancing Indian troops. </span></p>

The US and the West including the G8 nations identified Pakistan as the

condemned the Pakistani violation of the LoC. The European Union was also

troops were withdrawn from the Line of Control. Faced with growing

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Post war, Clinton in his autobiography
stated that “Sharif’s moves were perplexing” since the Indian prime minister
had travelled to Lahore to promote bilateral talks aimed at resolving the
Kashmir problem and “by crossing the Line of Control, Pakistan had wrecked the
bilateral talks.” He applauded <span class=0Text>Indian restraint for</span> <span
class=0Text>not crossing the LoC and escalating the conflict into an all-out
war. </span>One of the main concerns in the international community during the
Kargil crisis was that both neighbours had access to weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) and if the war intensified, it could have led to nuclear war.
Both countries had tested their nuclear capability in 1998. India conducted its
first test in 1974 while 1998’s test was Pakistan’s first-ever nuclear test.
Pakistani foreign secretary had made a statement warning that an escalation of
the limited conflict could lead Pakistan to use “any weapon” in its arsenal.
Many such ambiguous statements from officials of both countries were viewed as
an impending nuclear crisis. The nature of the India-Pakistan conflict took a
more sinister proportion when the U.S. received intelligence that Pakistani
nuclear warheads were being moved towards the border. Bill Clinton tried to
dissuade Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from nuclear brinkmanship, even
threatening Pakistan of dire consequences. Sensing a deteriorating military
scenario, diplomatic isolation, and the risks of a larger conventional and
nuclear war, Sharif ordered the Pakistani army to vacate the Kargil heights
Additionally, the threat of Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) included a
suspected use of chemical and even biological weapons. Pakistan accused India
of using chemical weapons and incendiary weapons such as napalm against the
Kashmiri fighters. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In the aftermath of the 1998 nuclear
tests India was under sanctions—the UN Security Council resolution 1172 had
condemned its actions, and multilateral and bilateral sanctions had India on
the back foot when 1999 came around. It was in this context that India decided
to not cross the Line of Control (LoC). It needed international opinion to be
in its favour—much like the support of the domestic audience, the support of
the international community was seen to be a potential “major force
multiplier.” Kargil was India’s first television war. This rallied public
opinion in favour of Indian action. Blood donations to the Indian Red Cross
Society in New Delhi increased during the war. Additionally, donations to
soldiers’ welfare funds increased exponentially. Images of wounded soldiers,
coffins, and bereaved families created awareness and solidarity. </span></p>

seen as a booster for the Indian armed forces. By the end of June, the U.S.

building up. Even Pakistan’s traditional allies in the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) chose to water down its resolutions against India. The Kargil
war marked the first instance in the history of South Asian conflicts that the
United States strongly supported India. It laid the foundation of the current

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The nation has had to face tasks of
immense magnitude and confront numerous problems, e.g., having to function in a
backward economy with an impoverished citizenry, being torn by violent social
conflicts, having to wage three major wars and face high costs of national
defence since 1947, gradual weakening of many of its institutions and being
constantly under international pressure. Despite all this, the political system
has, however, shown remarkable resilience and flexibility and has stood the
test of time and exhibited an ability to overcome several crises, for example
those of 1967-69 and of 1974-77. Indira Gandhi was to put it pithily in August
1972 when asked to list India’s achievements since 1947: ‘I would say our greatest
achievement is to have survived as a free and democratic nation.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Political stability has been an important
characteristic of independent India’s political system. There have been since
1967, rapid changes of governments in the states and since 1989, at the Centre,
but political stability has persisted. Different political forces and
formations have, waged their political battles in the political arena
prescribed by the Constitution. Changes in governments have taken place
according to constitutional and democratic rules and have invariably been
quietly and often gracefully accepted by those voted out of power by the
parliament or the electorate. People have taken it for granted that elections,
largely free and fair and held regularly, would decide who would rule the
country, a state or a panchayat. Greater political participation by the people,
including in its agitational forms, has not led to political instability. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The political system has also acquired
more or less unquestioned legitimacy, the few who have questioned its basic
tenets having fallen in line in the end. Thus, the Communists for several
decades challenged, though only in theory, the basic constitutional structure
as being geared to domination by the ruling, exploiting classes. But today they
are among the more vocal defenders of the Constitution. The communalists have
been trying from the outset to undermine the secular character of Indian
society and polity but even they pay verbal obeisance to secularism though they
try to distort its character through redefinition. Similarly, though
Jayaprakash Narayan questioned the multi-party parliamentary system during the
sixties and the early seventies, in the end he too accepted it after the
lifting of the Emergency in 1977. It is also significant that new aspiring
groups have been increasingly functioning within the broad parameters of the
political system to advance their interests. In fact, the very longevity of the
system, its continued functioning for over five decades has given it strength
and enabled it to strike deep roots. What W.H. Morris-Jones wrote in 1966 is
equally valid today: ‘The combination of political stability with the
establishment of a free, and freely moving, political system is what we are
entitled to call India’s political miracle.’</span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Popular agitational and electoral
politics have pushed this process further. India has certainly become over time
a politically more active society with an ever larger number of people and
social groups being politically mobilized and ‘incorporated into the body
politic’. The disadvantaged—women, agricultural labourers, small peasants, the
urban poor—have increasingly come to believe that their social condition is
unjust and is capable of being changed and that the desired change can be
brought about through politics and by the assertion of their political rights. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

power and value of their right to vote at various levels from the panchayats to
the parliament and of the benefits to be derived from its exercise. The
politics of booth-capturing, sale and purchase of votes, vote-banks and
patronage have been gradually receding and the voter’s choice becoming more
autonomous. One example is the increasing refusal of women to vote according to
the wishes of the male members of the family. Moreover, the poor and the
oppressed no longer accept dictates in regard to their choice of parties and
candidates. Though they are still open to populist appeals or appeals on
grounds of caste, region or religious community, they can no longer be easily
bullied or bought. </span></p>

that the role of caste in electoral politics has increased in recent years, but
quite often caste as a political factor has come in primarily when other
social, economic and political issues have been absent in the electoral arena
or when such issues have got grouped around caste as in the case of jobs and
educational opportunities. However, caste as a factor in politics has
invariably receded when broader national issues have come to occupy centre

sensitive to the larger social, economic and political issues but are also more
assertive and demanding—the people they vote for have to respond more actively
to their needs and demands. A major reason for the volatility of the voters’
behaviour in recent times, resulting in wide swings in electoral mandates is
the heightened voter expectation from the electoral process and the pressing
demand by the voters for performance and fulfilment of the promises made during
elections. Interestingly, elections at all levels have repeatedly shown that
people have little hesitation in voting against those in power because they are
no longer in awe or fear of people in authority. Politicization and mobilization
of the hitherto unpoliticized, which has been a continuous and ongoing process,
has sometimes taken the form of popular agitations, which have involved many of
the urban and some of the rural sections of society. They have, however, so far
left the rural poor untouched in large parts of the country. The politics of
protest has fed on demands for social justice, a share in the gains of
development and participation in decision-making. It has grown as the more
disadvantaged and oppressed classes and groups have come on the political
stage. Power struggle and popular mobilization in rural areas has, however,
often taken a casteist form in the absence of mobilization around class and of
struggle against the caste system and caste oppression and discrimination. A
major step towards further democratization of the political system and greater
people’s participation as also greater control over their own lives has been
recently taken with the inauguration of the freshly designed Panchayati Raj. </span></p>

today is to deepen democracy and make it more meaningful for the mass of the
people by enabling their greater participation in the political process. Voting
in periodic elections should not be regarded as the form of such participation.
So far there has been a general failure to politically mobilize the poor and
the disadvantaged and to shift the balance of social and political power in
their favour. The capitalists, who are major beneficiaries of economic
development, the landed peasants, who have gained most from land reforms and
the Green Revolution, the intelligentsia, the professionals, and the middle
classes, for whom immense opportunities have opened up after 1947, the government
and public sector employees, the organized working class and the upper layers
of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, all have been able to find
various means of protecting and promoting their interests. </span></p>

extent. They have been left out of the larger decision making process and have
had little voice in the day-to-day decisions affecting their lives. Their
access to resources being generated in the economy and the social system has
remained limited. They have been unable to turn the strength of numbers into
effective power because the level of their mobilization has been low. Their
political self-activity has lain dormant. </span></p>

in it? And did not Gandhi’s greatness lie precisely in promoting the
non-violent mobilization of the common people, thus making India’s freedom
struggle perhaps the greatest mass movement in world history. Jawaharlal
Nehru’s design for development and social transformation too depended on active
pressure from below; that he failed to implement his own design is another

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Political protest, along with the right
to vote, is one of the basic ingredients and a normal part of democratic politics.
For the oppressed sections of society, it is a critical part of their effective
participation in politics and is essential for the expression of their demands
and grievances. India is, therefore, going to have more, not less, protest as
different sections of society awaken to political life and work for faster
changes in their social condition. Protest movements are also very important
means for the people to force those in authority, particularly those wielding
political power, to respond to their demands. For the poor, perhaps this is the
only means of doing so. All this should be taken for granted. The important
question, therefore, is what are to be the forms of protest in a civil
libertarian representative democracy? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>As of now, Indians have, however, failed
to evolve appropriate forms of protest or a consensus on what they can or
cannot do. Popular protest movements by political parties, students, workers,
farmers, government employees and common citizens have most often taken the
form of demonstrations, hunger strikes, hartals, strikes in the work place or
educational institutions, dharnas, bandhs, gheraos, blockages of roads (rasta
roko), satyagraha, civil disobedience or disobedience of laws, leading to mass
arrests, and rioting. While some of these forms of protest are inherently
coercive, others more often than not culminate in violence and breakdown of law
and order and wanton violation of laws duly enacted by elected legislatures or
rules laid down by those authorized to do so. In many cases the protesters
coerce into joining their actions the very people they are supposed to
represent. The protest, especially in the form of demonstrations, quite often
ends up in attacks on cars, buses, trains, government and private property,
college buildings and so on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

an overreaction and an equally and often greater violent response by the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The purpose of such protest movements is,
however, not to convince the concerned authority of the justness of their
demands, or to win it over by ‘changing his heart’, to use a Gandhian phrase,
but to erode its authority and to coerce it to accept their demands. The blame
is, of course, not to be put only on one side, viz., the protesters. One reason
why many take to violent protest is because those in power turn a deaf ear to
peaceful protest and respond only to violent agitations. In this respect, what
Myron Weiner wrote in 1962 continues to have relevance:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Only when public order is endangered by a
mass movement is the government willing to make a concession, not because they
consider the demand legitimate, but because they then recognize the strength of
the group making the demand and its capacity for destructiveness. Thus, the
government often alternates between unresponsiveness to the demands of large
but peaceful groups and total concession to groups that press their demands
violently. In other words not only the organizers of popular agitations must
not coerce the authorities but try to change their hearts, the latter too must
be willing to undergo a change of heart whenever the protestors’ demands are
justified. We believe that just as the effort to prevent or suppress peaceful
protest is undemocratic, violent protest too poses a threat to the functioning
of democracy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>We may raise another question in this
context. Is even Satyagraha or nonviolent disobeying of laws legitimate in a
democratic system, and, if so, under what conditions or circumstances? For some
insights on this, we may turn for guidance to Gandhiji, the originator of
Satyagraha and in whose name protest movements have often been launched after
independence. On the eve of independence Gandhiji warned the people that satyagraha
and civil disobedience would no longer be the appropriate technique in free
India against a government elected by the people themselves. Even against the
British, he insisted on satyagraha and civil disobedience being completely
non-violent in word and deed. In any case, they were to be ‘the weapon of last
resort’ where gross injustice or immoral action by the government or other
authorities was involved and all other methods of redressal had been tried and
failed. The forms of protest tried out in independent India in imitation of
Gandhiji’s methods are, in fact, more akin to what he described as duragraha.
We may give a long quotation from the Conquest of Violence by the Gandhian
scholar, Joan V. Bondurant, to make the clear difference between Satyagraha and
duragraha as Gandhiji perceived it: In the refinement of language for
describing techniques of social action, duragraha serves to distinguish those
techniques in which the use of harassment obscures or precludes supportive acts
aimed at winning over the opponent … In those instances where democratic
procedures have been damaged through default or design, and where the legal
machinery has been turned towards a travesty of justice, civil disobedience may
be called into play … But if civil disobedience is carried out in the style of
duragraha, and not within the framework of satyagraha, it may well lead to
widespread indifference to legality and lend itself to those who would use
illegal tactics to undermine faith in democratic processes. Gandhiji would
never have advised giving up of protest which was to him the breath of the life
of a citizen. But he would also not have followed the route which some of the
Gandhians and most of the non-Gandhians have followed since his death. Smaller
men could only imitate him. He would, however, have, as he did promise,
innovated and evolved new forms of protest as also political activism suited to
a self-governing, democratic and civil libertarian polity. That is also the
task which leaders and organizers of popular protest should undertake today. </span></p>

economy. In fact, dependence of independent India on foreign capital and
foreign aid has been quite low. Today, neither finance nor any major or
economically strategic industry is under the control of foreign capital.
Multinational corporations have also played a relatively minor role in the
Indian economy. However, for advanced technology India still continues to be

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Immediately after independence, India
successfully developed an economic pattern of its own, namely, a mixed economy,
which placed equal emphasis on the active economic role of the state and the
market and developed a complementary relationship between the public and the

to carry through economic reforms; dismantling bureaucratic controls and the
licence-quota raj and developing a closer integration with the world economy,
through a gradual process, without hurting the economy or the people’s living
standards. India has also been able to transform its landlord-ridden,

agricultural production and productivity has come to an end with agriculture
growing more than three and a half times since 1950. India has achieved self-sufficiency
in food with foodgrains production having grown at 3 per cent per year. Famines
have become a distant memory, despite periodic droughts. The effect of the
monsoons on agricultural production lessens with the passage of time. Industry
has grown more than seventeen times since 1950. It has, moreover, undergone
structural transformation and considerable diversification. The weakness in the
basic and capital goods sector has been overcome to a considerable, though not
to the desirable extent. The share of this sector in total industrial
production has gone up sharply, and India’s dependence on the advanced
countries for basic goods and capital equipment has been greatly reduced. </span></p>

self-sufficient in defence production with capacity to produce long-range
missiles and atomic weapons, though it still has to purchase some items of
highly sophisticated defence equipment from abroad. It has also acquired a
large trained scientific and technical force. India’s national income has grown
more than seven-fold since 1950 and its per capita income by two and a half
times despite a very high rate of population growth. Referring to the Indian
economy, a sympathetic scholar, Francine R. Frankel, had written in 1978:
‘During much of the later 1960s and into the 1970s, there were chronic food
shortages, sharp inflationary price spirals, low availability of domestic raw
materials, shortfalls in industrial output, underutilized capacity in consumer
goods industries, stagnant or declining rates of public investment, and
diversion of scarce foreign exchange for imports of foodgrains and raw
materials.’ Such a situation is not easy to conceive today. And her prediction
that India was likely to ‘return to a low level equilibrium in which growth
rates did not significantly exceed the rate of population increase’9 was proved
false in the eighties itself. India has during the last few years entered a
period of high economic growth and is on the way to becoming an important
global economic power. As such it is bound to play a major role in the world
economy of the twenty first century. </span></p>

backward country by world standards, and the economic gap vis-à-vis the
advanced capitalist countries has widened instead of getting narrowed. This is
especially true of the technological gap between the two. Despite the long
strides Indian economy has taken, it still does not manage to fully satisfy the
basic needs of all of its people, what to speak of their aspirations, in part
because of the skewed income distribution. Nor is India’s economic independence
irreversible. We are living in a world capitalist system which is utterly
unequal and still divided into core and peripheral countries. The world system
even now consists of competing sovereign states and national economies; and the
core, developed countries do everything to maintain their privileged position
in the world economy while trying to weaken still further the relative position
of the states and economies of the periphery. India’s economic development,
though independent so far, has not reached that stage where its economy because
of being incorporated into and integrated with the world capitalist system, no
longer faces the danger of re-peripheralization, that is, subordination and
subservience to the core economies. </span></p>

be a new international division of labour where advanced technology, research
and development and other ‘brain’ activities would get concentrated in
currently advanced or core countries while India and other underdeveloped and
developing countries would be confined to production of traditional consumer
and producers’ goods and to ‘muscle and nerves’ activities. </span></p>

takes the form of domination through the investment of financial or industrial
capital. But, obviously, not all foreign capital investment poses this danger.
Indian economy, the Indian capitalist class and the Indian state have reached a
stage where they can definitely take in a certain quantum of foreign capital,
especially to serve the dual purposes of absorption of technology and
organizational structures and skills and provide a degree of competition to
indigenous entrepreneurs, private or state. What India has to avoid is the
pattern of Latin American style dependent development where the multinational
corporations control key economic sectors and positions and determine the
predominant patterns of internal production and international exchange. There
is the great danger that though foreign capital investment would result in
industrial development it would simultaneously perpetuate technological
backwardness relative to the advanced capitalist countries. While some
industries of the earlier phases or even of the latest phase of industrial
revolution would be transferred to India, the advanced ‘brain’ activities would
largely continue to be kept out of it and would remain the monopoly of the core
that is, advanced countries. While there is a need to moderate our former
hostility to foreign capital, the policy of controlling its direction and role
has to be continued. </span></p>

world index of human resources development, despite commendable achievements in
terms of economic growth and political democracy. A change in the social and
economic condition of the people has occurred since independence but at too
slow a rate. Putting forward the social objectives of planning before the
parliament in 1954, Jawaharlal Nehru had said: <span class=0Text>We are

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In over fifty years, independent India
has failed to eradicate poverty despite consistent economic growth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>This is a major blot on its record. Yet,
it is also true that though poverty remains, it has been lessened. In the early
sixties, the Planning Commission formulated the concept of the poverty line.
Below this line were people whose consumption, especially of foodgrains, did
not come up to a minimum level in terms of cal-ories. While no figures were
available for the colonial period or the early years after independence, it was
calculated that in 1970-71 nearly 59 per cent of the population was living
below the poverty line. Since then, this figure has been steadily going down.
It had declined to 51.3 in 1977-78, 44.5 in 1983, and 36 in 1993-94. The
obverse side of these figures is that over 300 million people, equal to the
population of India at the moment of freedom, are still below the poverty line.
Moreover, poverty varies across different states, being as high as 63 per cent
in Bihar, and 20 per cent in Punjab and Haryana in 1993-94. The main brunt of
poverty is borne by landless agricultural labourers, small and marginal farmers
and the urban poor. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The reduction in poverty levels was
largely the result of various antipoverty, mostly employment generating,
programmes initiated in the mid seventies by the Indira Gandhi government under
the guidance of one of India’s finest and socially committed economists,
Sukhamoy Chakravarty. These programmes have been <span class=0Text>173</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>pursued more vigorously, though still
inadequately financed, since 1984-85. As the figures show, they have had a
significant impact despite corruption and the failure to always reach the
targeted groups. Particularly effective has been the Employment Guarantee
Scheme (EGS) in Maharashtra. In this context, it may be pertinent to point out
that what made possible the taking-up and implementation of the anti-poverty
programmes, was the radical restructuring of the Indian economy brought about
by the Nehruvian planning strategy during the fifties and sixties. Even apart
from the proof of the poverty line statistics, it is observed that Indians no
longer live in abysmal poverty as they did under colonialism. The mass
starvation of that period has been conquered. India has not had a major famine
since the Bengal famine of 1943. In the worst drought of the century in 1987-88
very few died of hunger or disease. The same was the experience of the serious
droughts of 1965-67 and 1972-73. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Similarly, in the colonial period and the
immediate post-independence years a vast number of Indians went without two
meals a day, several months in a year, and sometimes without even one meal. A
recent study has shown that the number of people who could not obtain two
square meals a day had dropped to 19 per cent of the households in 1983 and to
less than 5 per cent in 1994.12</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The reduction in the incidence of poverty
is also indicated by the greater availability of foodgrains and other food
items over the years. For example, while per capita foodgrains consumption fell
by over 24 per cent between 1901 and 1941, it increased from 394.9 grams per
day in 1951 to 468.8 grams per day in 1971 and 507.7 grams per day in 1995—an
overall increase of 28 per cent. This growth in availability is also evident in
the case of several other items of consumption. The annual availability of
cloth per head was 9 metres in 1950, 15 metres in 1960 and 29.3 metres in 1995.
The chart below presents the picture of annual per head availability of certain
other important articles of consumption. Similarly, from 1950 to 1996,
production of milk has increased four times, from 17 million tons to 68.3
million tons, of eggs more than fifteen times, from 1,832 million to 28,400
million, and fish more than seven times, from 752 thousand tons to 5388 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>We have already pointed out earlier, that
per capita income, a crucial aspect of standard of living, has increased by 250
per cent from 1950 to 1995. From 1975 to 1995, it has grown at the rate of 2.8
per cent per year, which compares favourably with the rates of increase in per
capita income in advanced countries at a comparative stage of development:
Britain (1.34 per cent from 1855 to 1967), France (1.7 per cent from 1861 to
1966), Germany (1.83 per cent from 1850 to 1967), and the USA (1.75 per cent
from 1834 to 1967). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Still, the incidence of poverty and
especially endemic undernourishment, particularly among children, is very much
there, though not stark hunger or utter destitution, except among the very old
and the handi-capped. A dent in poverty has been made, though it is not deep
enough. The problem of poverty has been further compounded by the existence of
glaring inequality, social and economic. While the poor have not become poorer
and have derived some benefit from economic growth, the gap between them and
the rich has grown before our very eyes. The fruits of this growth and the
resulting significant rise in national income have been disproportionately
gathered by a few belonging to the upper and to a certain extent middle layers
of society. Misdistribution of income, opportunities and power has been,
moreover, built into the very social and class structure of the country. With
the onset of liberalization of the economy and economic development on the
basis of ‘the animal spirits of the capitalists’, inequality is likely to grow
in the short run, but if the government can provide the necessary skills and
infrastructure and back it with fair-predictable tax policies, inequality will
come down in the long run. </span></p>

the quality of life of the masses in India is another major area of neglect as
their physical and social needs have not been met even at a minimally desired
level. Some progress has been made in this respect but it has been tardy and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>We will first take up three of these
pertaining to health and education-life expectancy at birth, infant mortality
rate (MR) and literacy—which are most commonly used in discussions on the
subject. A comparison of the post-independence record in these fields with that
of the colonial period shows that India’s performance has been quite creditable
during the last three decades. This, despite the fact that health and education
are two areas which have received low priority from successive central and
state governments in India. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>However, a very brief comparison of the
statistical progress made by some other countries such as China and Sri Lanka
reveals how far we are lagging behind in regard to these important areas and
what we still have to achieve. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>An Indian’s life expectancy at birth
which was 32 years in 1950 rose to 45.6 years in 1970 and to 63 years in
1998—very creditable indeed. But it was already 69.8 and 73.1 years in 1997 in
China and Sri Lanka respectively. The rise in life expectancy in India was
basically the result of the steep fall in death rate per thousand from 27.4 in
1940 to 14.9 in 1970 and 8.9 in 1997. Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live
births which was 227 in 1941 had fallen to 130 in 1970 and to 71 in 1997.
However, it was much lower for China (38) and Sri Lanka (17) in 1997. Another
sad fact observed is that too many women still die in India during childbirth.
The current maternity mortality rate per hundred thousand live births in India
is as high as 507 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>compared to 95 in China and 140 in Sri
Lanka. One reason for this is that 60 per cent of all child births in rural
India are still attended to only by untrained persons. Perhaps India’s biggest
failure is the continuation of high illiteracy among its people. In 1950,
nearly 82 per cent Indians were illiterate; this figure was still as high as 38
per cent in 1997. The comparative figures for China and Sri Lanka were as low
as 17.1 and 9.3 </span></p>

gender gap in case of literacy was astonishingly high in India, nearly twice as
many women being illiterate as men. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>As has been shown in earlier chapters,
India’s record in higher and technical education is far better. Also, there has
been rapid expansion of school education in the last decade with increase in
the percentage of school age children going to school and over 88 per cent
villages being provided with primary schools. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The flip side is the deterioration in the
quality of education both in the case of schools and institutions of higher
education in recent years. With rare exceptions the system of public education
has become virtually dysfunctional with the ‘cooperation’ of all concerned—the
government, political parties, educational administrators, teachers, parents
and students. The standard of rural schools has fallen so low that quite often
a child, who has spent five years in school, is not able to read or write at
all and is, at the most, able to write only his name, if even that. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Health care, especially in rural areas,
is another area of human development that has been grossly neglected in the
last fifty years. For example, during the last decade, 19 per cent of Indians
had no access to safe water, 25 per cent to health services, 71 per cent to
sanitation. 53 per cent of Indian children under five are underweight, though this
ratio has been declining in the last few years. The bright spot in this respect
is the great success of the programmes for the immunization of children against
polio, smallpox, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. As in
the case of education, in the field of public health too, the quality of
services provided is quite poor in most states, especially of the Hindi belt.
The housing situation shows improvement in rural areas of India where the
number of pucca houses has increased dramatically, but it has been
deteriorating in urban areas, with millions being homeless and living on
pavements or in jhuggis (shanties), unprotected from sun, rain or cold and with
hardly any provision for water, electricity or sanitation. Even otherwise,
Indian cities have been declining in regard to many aspects of the quality of
life—sanitation, housing, transport, electric supply, schooling. Also there is
very low consumption, especially in rural areas, of goods which make life
easier and more joyful: scooters and motorcycles, radios, electric fans,
room-coolers, telephones, televisions, electric or gas or even coal chullahs,
refrigerators, washing machines, though their use is way above that at the time
of independence. </span></p>

and villages electrified has expanded rapidly since 1950. In the nineties,
nearly 43 per cent of the rural and almost all the urban households, except the
jhuggis, have acquired electric connections. Electricity generation has gone up
from 5.1 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 1950 to 434 billion KWh in 1996.
Indians, both rural and urban, have also acquired greater access to media and
entertainment: newspapers, magazines, films, music and television. </span></p>

unemployment in India also has a highly adverse impact on the quality of life
and not only at the level of physical existence. Economic development has
failed to create enough jobs in industry and services to make a serious impact
on the unemployment of the landless and the rural and urban educated, thus
introducing serious psychological, social and economic disequilibrium in their
lives. We may make a few other observations. Both in terms of development and
poverty and the quality of life, there exists a great deal of disparity between
different states and among their sub-regions which has to be rectified. An
improvement in the quality of life or in the indices of human development would
invariably require the state to play a more active role in the social sector

economic development and transformation of the agricultural and industrial
production base of society during the last half century, India has now the
resources to further its social agenda. The earlier debate whether a poor
society could pursue social justice is no longer relevant. There is no longer
any need to counterpose increase in production and productivity to the removal
of poverty and better distribution of wealth and opportunities. Nehru’s dilemma
as to how to combine development with equity has also disappeared, for we can
now achieve this. It would, therefore, not be wrong to expect and to predict

despite many weaknesses, provides them the framework in which to exercise that
power. The power of the people in a democracy is the ‘liberating deluge’ that
