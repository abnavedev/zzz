Introduction : Keynesian Revolution Classical economists were of the view that there is always full employment in the economy or there is always a tendency towards full employment in the economy. This view of them was based upon their belief in Say’s Law of Markets. They thought that when there is unemployment in the economy, then, given the free and perfect competition in the economy, certain economic forces automatically operate in such a way that the condition of full employment is restored. During the period 1929- 33, there occurred great depression in the capitalist countries which caused huge unemployment of labour and other resources in those countries and as a result level of national income fell down. Due to this depression many factories were closed in these countries and factories which were working were also not being used to their full productive capacity. In other words, there appeared a good deal of excess productive capacity in these economies. As a result of unemployment, low income and production created by depression, people had to undergo a good deal of sufferings. This condition of depression and unemployment did not seem to disappear automatically. Therefore, people’s belief in the classical economic thought regarding the tendency to full employment was shaken. Thus, the classical theory of full employment was proved empirically wrong. In this background, Keynes wrote his book, General Theory of Employment. Interest and Money, in which he challenged the validity of the classical theory of employment. Not only did he criticise the classical theory of full employment and proved it wrong but also presented a new theory of income and employment which is generally believed to be correct and valid by modern economists. Keynes brought about such a fundamental and important change in our economic thought at that time that the Keynesian theory is generally known as new economics. By being impressed by the fundamental and revolutionary nature of change in our economic theory by Keynes, many economists called his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money as the Keynesian Revolution. We explain below the outline of Keynes’s theory of employment. We have critically examined the classical theory of employment and Say’s Law of Markets on which the classical theory is based. Keynes in his eminent work, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, not only criticised the classical Say’s law but also propounded a new theory of income and employment. Keynes in his work put forward a more systematic and realistic analysis of the determinants of employment in an advanced capitalist economy and the factors which lead to unemployment. Keynes tried to prove that full employment is not a normal feature of an advanced capitalist economy and that underemployment equilibrium is its normal feature. Keynes also invented new tools and concepts of economic analysis in terms of which he propounded his theory of income and employment. These new tools and concepts are propensity to consume, multiplier, marginal efficiency of capital and liquidity preference. We will explain these concepts in detail in later chapters. Here we will explain only the outline of the Keynesian theory of income and employment. 
It is important to note that Keynesian theory of income and employment is a short-run theory because Keynes assumes that the amount of capital, the size of population and labour force, technology, efficiency of labourers, etc., do not change. That is why in Keynesian theory, the amount of employment depends upon the level of national income and production. This is because, given the amount of capital, technology and labour efficiency, increase in income and output can be obtained by employment of more labour. Therefore, in the Keynesian short run, the higher the level of national income, the greater the amount of employment; and lower the level of national income, the lower the amount of employment. Hence Keynes’s theory of employment determination is also Keynes’s theory of income determination. But, for the simplicity, in this chapter we shall explain the Keynesian theory in terms of employment and all the diagrams we will draw will show explicitly the determination of employment. In the next chapter, we will explain Keynesian theory in terms of national income through income expenditure analysis and the diagrams which we will draw will explicitly show the income determination. But it is important to note that the factors that determine the level of income are the same as those that determine the level of employment; only the diagrams used to show their determination are different. It is important to note that Keynes thought that prices and wages do not adjust quickly to balance demand and supply. Therefore, in his theory of income and employment he assumes that prices and money wages remain constant. KEYNES’S THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT: PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE DEMAND At the outset, it may be noted that in Keynesian theory of income and employment determination, principle of effective demand occupies a significant place. In an advanced capitalist economy, the level of employment depends upon the level of aggregate effective demand, the greater the level of effective demand, the greater the amount of employment in the economy. How many men will be employed by an individual firm depends upon the number of persons employed which will make maximum profits. Likewise, in the whole economy, how many men will be employed by firms or entrepreneurs in the economy depends upon the fact that they make their individual profits. In the whole economy, the amount of employment is determined by aggregate supply and aggregate demand. We will now discuss below these concepts of aggregate supply and aggregate demand function and will show how they determine the equilibrium level of employment. Aggregate Supply Function When entrepreneurs employ some people they incur some cost of production. If the proceeds obtained from the sale of output produced by a certain number of people employed is greater than the cost of production incurred, it will be worthwhile to employ them. The cost of production incurred on the employment of a certain number of labourers must be received by the entrepreneur, otherwise they will not produce and provide employment to labour. At any given level of employment of labour, aggregate supply price is the total amount of money which all the entrepreneurs in the economy taken together must expect to receive from the sale of the output produced by the given number of labourers employed. In other words, aggregate supply price is the total cost of production incurred by employing a certain given number of labourers. It is obvious that if the cost of production incurred by the entrepreneur in employing a certain number of labourers is not covered, they will reduce the amount of employment offered. As the amount of employment of labour increases, the total cost of production will also increase. Therefore, aggregate supply price will rise as more labour is employed to produce goods and services. Keynes’s aggregate supply function (curve) shows the relationship between the number of workers employed and the receipts which all firms in the economy must get if it is just worth employing them, prices remaining constant. In other words, Keynes’s aggregate supply function (curve) shows the relationship between the number of workers employed and the aggregate supply price. Thus we can construct a schedule or curve of aggregate supply showing aggregate supply price at different levels of employment. 80 Macroeconomics : Theory and Policy Let us now explain in detail the factors on which aggregate supply curve depends. The aggregate supply curve depends ultimately on the physical and technical conditions of production (that is, capital stock, the state of technology and the nature of production function). However, physical and technical conditions remain constant in the short run. Hence, given these technical conditions, the level of output can be increased only by increasing employment of labour. But, when output and employment are increased, more cost of production is incurred. Whether production is subject to the law of increasing, diminishing or constant returns, when more workers are employed to increase production, more cost has to be incurred since additional workers are to be paid wages. Hence, more workers will be employed only if the entrepreneurs must expect to receive greater revenue so as to cover the rise in cost incurred. Therefore, the aggregate supply curve slopes upward to the right. The slope of the aggregate supply curve (function) depends on the physical or technical conditions of production. If the technical conditions are such that with the increase in output, marginal cost of production does not rise, the aggregate supply curve will be a straight line. On the other hand, if technical conditions are such that diminishing returns occur with the increase in employment of labour, marginal cost of production will rise with the increase in the level of output. This will make the slope of aggregate supply curve to increase with the increase in employment of labour. Besides, if with the increase in employment of labour, wage rate of labour rises, the slope of aggregate supply curve will increase with the employment of more labour. It is however worth noting that Keynes thought in conditions of depression/recession when huge unemployment of labour prevailed in the economy, with the increase in employment of labour to produce more, wage rate will remain constant. Assuming that marginal cost of production rises with the increase in employment of labour, upward rising aggregate supply curve AS with increasing slope as more labour is employed is shown in Fig. 4.1. This aggregate supply curve (function) depicts rising aggregate supply price at various levels of labour employment. We have said that the aggregate supply is determined by the physical and technical conditions prevailing in the economy, that is, the quantity and quality of labour, stock of capital and raw materials available in the economy and the state of technology. As these changes, or as production technology is improved, AS curve will also change. But in the analysis of the determination of employment in the advanced capitalist economies in the short run aggregate supply curve can be assumed to be given and constant. This is for the simple reason that in times of depression the main problem of advanced capitalist economies is how to employ idle manpower and capital resources to increase production by raising demand and not that how the productive capacity be raised by augmenting the stock of capital or by improving the techniques of production. That is why Keynes assumed the AS curve to be constant and paid greater attention to the factors determining aggregate demand. The need of the moment in times of recession is to increase aggregate demand so that the equilibrium be achieved at full-employment level. When aggregate demand is increased, the aggregate demand curve will shift upward and it will intersect the AS curve more on the right, i.e., the number of men employed will increase. When the full-employment level has been reached, then, given the stock of fixed capital and the prevailing technology, output and employment cannot be further increased by increasing aggregate demand. Under such conditions increase in aggregate demand will only result in inflation. In such a situation, it becomes necessary to cause a rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve by making addition to the stock of capital and effecting improvements in production technology. This will contain the inflationary pressures. In other words, efforts should be made to increase aggregate supply when full-employment level has already been achieved and the economy is in the grip of inflation. The curve of aggregate supply price AS starts from the point of origin and slopes upward to the right. In the beginning aggregate supply price curve AS rises slowly, afterwards it rises rapidly. This curve AS shows that as the number of men employed is increased, the aggregate supply price rises slowly in the beginning and rapidly afterwards. This is because cost of production rises as more people are employed and further due to the operations of law of diminishing returns total cost of production increases at an increasing rate. Once all the men willing to get employment are employed, then we have a state of full employment. When the state of full employment is reached further increases in aggregate demand or expenditure will be unable to increase employment further since output of goods and services cannot be increased further as no more labour is available for production after full-employment level is reached. Therefore, aggregate supply curve assumes a vertical shape after full employment is reached. In Fig. 4.1, ONF is the level of full employment at which aggregate supply curve assumes a vertical shape. Aggregate Demand Function It is aggregate demand function which plays a more important role in the determination of employment. Aggregate demand function (curve) shows for each possible level of employment the total sum of money (proceeds) which all the firms or entrepreneurs in the economy actually expect to receive from the sale of output produced by those workers employed in the economy. The amount of expenditure actually expected by when a given number of workers are employed to produce goods and services is called aggregate demand price. Like the aggregate supply price, aggregate demand price also varies at different levels of employment. This is because at different levels of employment different income levels would be generated and at different income levels, expenditure, especially consumption expenditure, would be different. Aggregate demand has the following four components : (1) Consumption demand, (2) Investment demand, (3) Government expenditure, and (4) Net Exports (that is, exports-imports). In this introduction to the theory of employment, we confine ourselves to the consumption demand and investment demand and will introduce Government expenditure and net exports in a later chapter of this book. X O Y N 1 N 2 N F Receipts Number of Persons Employed AS R E AD C H M T Involuntary unemployment Fig. 4.1. Determination of Employment Thus the factors which determine aggregate demand are the factors which determine consumption demand and investment demand. Consumption demand depends on disposable income on the one hand and propensity to consume on the other. Propensity to consume depends on some subjective factors such as willingness to save, desire to imitate others’ higher levels of living and objective factors such as price level, taxation policy of the Government, rate of interest. Given these factors, changes in which cause a shift in the entire consumption function, the higher the level of disposable income, the greater the amount of consumption demand. As regards investment demand, according 82 Macroeconomics : Theory and Policy to Keynes, it is determined by rate of interest on the one hand and marginal efficiency of capital on the other. While rate of interest is more or less sticky, it is changes in marginal efficiency of capital (i.e., expected rate of return) that cause frequent changes in inducement to invest. Marginal efficiency of capital means expected rate of profit by the entrepreneurs from the investment they propose to undertake. When prospects for profit-making in future are bright, there will be more investment. If investors become pessimistic about profit-earning in future, they will undertake less new investment. But what are the factors on which business expectations about opportunities of making profits depend. The expected rate of profits (which Keynes calls marginal efficiency of capital) of business men depends on their estimates of consumer demand for goods, taxation policy of the Government, expectations regarding changes in technology. It is worth noting that it is due to the frequent changes in business expectations that investment demand is volatile. When business men become pessimistic about profit earning, investment declines which lowers aggregate demand. On the other hand, when entrepreneurs become bullish or optimistic, they undertake new investment on a large scale which raises the level of aggregate demand of the economy. On the other hand, consumption function, according to Keynes, remains stable in the short run. However, amount of consumption demand increases as the income rises in the short run. Therefore, we can construct a schedule or curve of aggregate demand showing different aggregate demand prices at different levels of employment. The curve of aggregate demand is shown by the curve AD in Fig. 4.1. The aggregate demand price curve also rises from left to right. It will be seen in Fig. 4.1 that when ON1 number of men are employed, the aggregate demand price is OH and when ON2 men are employed, aggregate demand price is OM. Determination of the Equilibrium Level of Employment by Effective Demand In Fig. 4.1 we have shown together aggregate supply curve and aggregate demand curve. The amount of employment is measured along the X-axis and the receipts or proceeds obtained at various levels of employment are measured along the Y-axis. As said above, aggregate supply curve shows the revenue or receipts which must be received by the entrepreneurs so as to provide employment to different numbers of workers, whereas aggregate demand curve shows proceeds or receipts which entrepreneurs actually do expect to receive at different levels of employment and production. These aggregate demand and the aggregate supply curves determine the level of employment in the economy. Given that the perfect competition prevails in the economy, then so long as opportunities to earn profits or make money exist, the entrepreneurs will increase the level of employment. The opportunities to make profits exist if aggregate demand price is greater than the aggregate supply price for a given number of employment. This analysis explains determination of national income by relating income (output) to aggregate expenditure on goods and services. Thus, aggregate expenditure shows aggregate demand for goods and services. For example, in Figure 4.1 at ON1 number of persons employed aggregate demand price OH exceeds aggregate supply price OC. Therefore, it is profitable to offer employment to ON1 workers. Therefore, so long as aggregate demand price exceeds aggregate supply price, the entrepreneurs will go on employing extra workers. When at a level of employment aggregate demand price becomes equal to aggregate supply price, then after this it will be no more profitable to employ workers. Since beyond this point aggregate supply price will exceed aggregate demand price, the cost of production incurred on employing a certain number of people will not be covered. Therefore, when aggregate demand price falls short of aggregate supply price, employment of labour will fall. Equilibrium level of employment is determined by the intersection of aggregate demand curve and the aggregate supply curve, where the amount of money which the entrepreneurs actually expect to receive from employing a certain number of workers is equal to the amount of money which they must receive. In other words, the employment of labour will be in equilibrium at the level at which aggregate demand price equals aggregate supply price. It will be seen from Fig. 4.1 that aggregate supply curve and aggregate demand curve intersect at point E and therefore ON2 level of employment is determined. It will be noticed that at less than ON2 level of employment, aggregate demand curve AD lies above the aggregate supply curve AS showing that it is profitable to expand the amount of employment. However, beyond ON2 amount of employment, the aggregate demand curve AD lies below aggregate supply curve AS, which shows that it is no more profitable to employ extra workers beyond ON2. We, therefore, conclude that ON2 is the equilibrium level of employment which will be determined by aggregate demand curve AD and aggregate supply curve AS. Effective Demand : Further Clarification We are now in a position to explain more clearly what effective demand means and how it is important for determination of employment and output in the economy. We have seen that the magnitude of employment in the economy is determined by the equilibrium between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. There is an aggregate demand function for an economy which shows aggregate demand price at varying levels of employment. But of these varying levels of employment the aggregate demand at which a level of employment is also equal to the aggregate supply is called effective demand. In other words, effective demand is that aggregate demand price which becomes ‘effective’ because it is equal to aggregate supply price and thus represents a position of short-run equilibrium. There are several other points on the aggregate demand curve but what distinguishes effective demand from all these points is that at this point the aggregate demand price is equal to aggregate supply price. On all other points, aggregate demand price is either more or less than aggregate supply price. It is thus clear that employment in the economy in the short run is determined by effective demand. The higher the level of effective demand, the greater is the volume of employment, and vice versa. Unemployment is due to the deficiency of effective demand and the basic remedy to remove this unemployment is to raise the level of the effective demand. The classical economists believed that effective demand was always large enough to ensure full employment. But Keynes proved that it was not so and that is why the phenomenon of unemployment is common in free-market capitalist economies. Underemployment Equilibrium : The Problem of Demand Deficiency It is not necessary that the equilibrium level of employment is always at full employment. Equality between aggregate demand and aggregate supply does not necessarily indicate the full employment X O Y N 2 N F Receipts Labour Employment AS R E AD AD¬ Fig. 4.2. Raising Aggregate Demand Curve to Achieve Full Employment 84 Macroeconomics : Theory and Policy level. The economy can be in equilibrium at less than full employment or, in other words, an underemployment equilibrium can exist. The classical economists denied that there could be an equilibrium at less than full employment, because they believed that supply would always create its own demand and therefore no problem of deficiency of aggregate effective demand would be experienced. Keynes demolished the classical thesis of full employment both on theoretical grounds and on the basis of illustrations from real life. It will be seen from Fig. 4.2 that in the situation of equilibrium at the employment level ON2, the N2NF persons remain unemployed. Thus equilibrium at E represents an underemployment equilibrium (or, in other words, less than full-employment equilibrium). It is important to note that N2NF persons are involuntarily unemployed: they are willing to work at the existing wage rates but are unable to find jobs. It is important to remember that, according to Keynes, this unemployment is due to deficiency of aggregate demand. This unemployment will be removed and full-employment equilibrium will be reached if through increase in investment demand or increase in consumption, or increase in both, aggregate demand curve shifts upward so that it intersects the aggregate supply curve at point R as depicted in Fig. 4.2. It will be seen that with the intersection of aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves at point R, equilibrium is established at full-employment level ONF. According to Keynes, aggregate demand price and aggregate supply price will be equal at full employment only if investment demand is sufficient to cover the gap between the aggregate supply price corresponding to full-employment level and the consumption expenditure out of income at the full-employment level. The view of Keynes is that when investment demand falls short of this gap between full-employment income and consumption recession occurs resulting in the emergence of involuntary unemployment. According to him, when inducement to invest in capitalist countries declines due to the fall in marginal efficiency of capital (i.e., expected rate of profit), aggregate demand falls so that equilibrium is established at less than full-employment level. As a result, output and income of the community also fall. SUMMARY OF KEYNES’S THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT After explaining Keynes’s theory of employment at some length, we are now in a position to describe it in a summary form bringing out relationship between various elements or factors that go to determine the equilibrium level of employment. 1. Level of output or income of a country depends on the level of employment. Given the capital stock and technology, greater the employment of labour, higher the level of aggregate output or national income. 2. The level of employment depends on the magnitude of effective demand which is the sum of consumption demand and investment demand at the point where aggregate supply curve intersects the aggregate demand curve. 3. Aggregate supply of an economy depends on physical and technical conditions of production. Since these factors do not change much in the short run, aggregate supply curve remains constant in the short run. Aggregate supply curve slopes upward to the right as level of employment increases. This is because with the increase in labour employment, the greater cost has to be incurred. 4. Aggregate demand in a simple Keynesian model consists of consumption demand and investment demand. Since the consumption demand increases with the increase in labour employment, aggregate demand curve also slopes upward to the right. In Keynes’s model, investment demand is regarded as autonomous of changes in income or employment. 5. Consumption demand depends on propensity to consume on the one hand and disposable income on the other. Propensity to consume of a community does not change much in the short run. Therefore, consumption function which relates consumption demand with the level of income remains stable in the short run. 6. Investment demand depends on the rate of interest and marginal efficiency of capital. According to Keynes, rate of interest is determined by supply of money and the state of liquidity preference. Marginal efficiency of capital (i.e., expected rate of profit) depends on the expected future yields or profit expectations of entrepreneurs on the one hand and replacement cost of capital on the other. 7. According to Keynes, while rate of interest is more or less sticky, it is frequent changes in profit expectations of the entrepreneurs, that is, changes in marginal efficiency of capital that cause a great deal of fluctuations in investment by entrepreneurs. Investment demand is thus highly volatile and causes recession or depression when it falls, and boom and prosperity when it increases significantly. We summarise below the various determinants of employment and income (output) in a tabular form. UNEMPLOYMENT : KEYNES’S MONEY-WAGE RIGIDITY MODEL According to Keynes, due to money-wage rigidity, that is, downward inflexibility of money wages results in involuntary unemployment of labour. The workers are rendered unemployed because at a given wage rate supply of labour exceeds demand for labour. Keynes believed that money wage would not change sufficiently in the short run to keep the economy at full employment. Classical economists believed that money wage rate is perfectly flexible and adjusts to bring demand for and supply of labour in equilibrium and keep the economy at full-employment level. To understand money wage rigidity which results in unemployment we have to examine why labour market does not clear through reduction in money wages, Keynes gave three reasons for the stickiness of money wage rate. It may be noted that stickiness or rigidity of money wage implies that money wage rate will not quickly change, especially in the downward direction to keep equilibrium at full-employment level. Causes of Money Wage Rigidity 1. Money Illusion. The first reason why firms fail to cut wages despite an excess supply of labour is that workers will resist any move for cut in money wages though they might accept fall in real wages brought about by rise in prices of commodities. Keynes attributed this to money illusion on the part of the workers. By money illusion it is meant that workers fail to realise that value of money, that is, its purchasing power in terms of commodities, changes when prices rise. They regard money such as a rupee as something which has a stable value or purchasing power, that a rupee is a rupee and a dollar is a dollar with fixed 86 Macroeconomics : Theory and Policy real purchasing power. Therefore, while they would strongly oppose and resist any cut in money wages, they would not resist much if their real wages are reduced through rise in prices of commodities with money wages remaining constant. Thus Keynes wrote, “Whilst workers will usually resist a reduction of money wages, it is not their practice to withdraw their labour whenever there is a rise in the price of wage goods”. There are two reasons for existence of money illusion. (i) First reason for the existence of money illusion is that workers of a firm or industry think that though rise in prices reduces their real wages, but that this rise in prices equally affects workers in other industries so that their relative wages as compared to those employed in other industries remain the same. Therefore, workers who are more concerned with their relative position with other workers will strongly resist the cut in their money wages, while they will not oppose so strongly their cut in real wages through rise in the general price level. (ii) The second reason for strong resistance to cut in money wages is that the workers blame their own employers for this, whereas they think that a cut in real wages through rise in prices in general is the outcome of the working of general economic forces over which strikes in an industry would have little effect. However, it does not necessarily mean that trade unions remain silent spectators if they feel that changes in Government policy adversely affect their economic interests. From the above two reasons given for money illusion it follows that if additional employment can be created by lowering real wages, it is more practical to do so through bringing about rise in general price level rather than by cutting money wages. 2. Wage Fixation Through Contracts. In most of the free market economies such as those of USA and Great Britain, wages are fixed by the firms through contracts made with the workers for a year or two. There is little possibility of changing money wages fixed through contracts when the situation of either labour surplus or shortage emerges. For workers organised into trade unions wages are even rigid. Through collective bargaining by trade unions with the employers wage scales are fixed for 3 to 4 years by contract. Money wages cannot be changed when either surplus or shortage of labour emerges during the period of the contract. Trade unions of workers never accept wage cuts even if some of union workers remain unemployed. Thus the sticky or rigid money wages lead to the existence of involuntary unemployment. This means that labour market does not clear in the short run. 3. Minimum Wage Laws. Another reason for money-wage rigidity or, what is also called money-wage stickiness, is the intervention by the Government in fixing minimum wages below which employers are not permitted to pay wages to the workers. 4. Efficiency Wages. Another factor which accounts for money-wage rigidity is that employers themselves are not interested in lowering wages as high wages make workers more efficient and productive. The adverse effect of lower wages on workers’ efficiency may explain the unwillingness on the part of employers to cut money wages despite the excess supply of or unemployment of workers at higher money wages. We have explained above the practical difficulties pointed out by Keynes and his followers which are faced by firms in reducing wages and which therefore explain money-wage rigidity or stickiness. The sticky or rigid money wages above the equilibrium level cause unemployment of labour. Price Flexibility and Rigid Money Wage : Keynes’s View of Involuntary Unemployment In Keynes’s contractual view of labour market, it is assumed that whereas prices are free to vary, the money wage is fixed. It is important to note that Keynesians do not believe that money wage rate is completely fixed or sticky. What do they actually mean by sticky wages is that money wages do not fall quickly to bring demand for and supply of labour in equilibrium at full employment. In their view money wages are very slow to adjust sufficiently to ensure full employment of labour when there is a decline in aggregate demand resulting in lowering of prices of products. As a consequence, involuntary unemployment comes into existence. It may be further noted that Keynes was particularly concerned with downward rigidity of money wages at which the demand for labour exceeds the supply of labour and consequently unemployment or excess supply of labour emerges. It is important to note that Keynes accepted the classical theory of labour demand according to which firms demand labour up to the point at which real wage rate (that is, money wage rate divided by the price level or, W/P) is equal to the marginal product of labour. At a higher real wage rate, less amount of labour will be demanded and, at a lower real wage rate, more labour will be demanded or employed. In other words, demand curve of labour is downward sloping. Keynes’s theory of involuntary unemployment based on price flexibility and money wage rigidity is depicted in Figure 4.3. Fig. 4.3. Keynes’s Rigid Money Wage and Flexible Price Model : The Emergence of Involuntary Unemployment In panel (b) of Fig. 4.3 short-run aggregate supply curve AS and aggregate demand curve AD0 have been drawn and through their interaction determine price level P0 and the level of real GNP equal to Y0.* It is important to note that short-run aggregate supply curve AS has been drawn with a given fixed money wage rate, say W0. In panel (a) of Figure 4.3 the level of labour employment N0 shows the number of jobs when the economy is producing Y0 level of national output in panel (b) corresponding to the equilibrium between aggregate supply AS and aggregate demand AD0 at price level P0, with a fixed money wage and the level of GNP equal to Y0. The labour market must be in equilibrium at point E0 or real image rate W0/P0 at which N0 workers are demanded and employed. All those who are willing to get jobs at the real wage rate W0/P0 are in fact demanded and employed. Thus, equilibrium at E0, or at level of employment N0 represents full-employment equilibrium. Now consider again panel (b) of Fig. 4.3. Suppose due to fall in marginal efficiency of capital there is reduction in investment demand which along with its multiplier effect causes a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve AD. Since Keynes believed that with a fixed money wage rate aggregate supply curve AS is given and remains unchanged, it will be seen from panel (b) of Fig. 4.3 that new aggregate demand curve AD1 and the fixed aggregate supply curve AS intersect at point K * Students should note that concepts of aggregate demand curve (AD) and aggregate supply curve (AS) used in this Figure 4.3 are different from those used earlier in this chapter. Aggregate demand curve drawn in this Figure 4.3, means the total quantity of goods and services, households, firms and Government are willing to buy at various price levels. Similarly, aggregate supply curve (AS) here means the total output of goods and services that all firms in the economy are willing to produce and supply at different price levels. These concepts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves with price flexibility will be explained in a separate chapter. 88 Macroeconomics : Theory and Policy determining new equilibrium lower price P1 and smaller real GNP equal to Y1. Keynes asserted that the economy would remain stuck at point K with less than full-employment level of output Y1 and lower price level P1. Now, a glance at panel (a) of Fig. 4.3 shows that with fixed money image W0 and lower price level P1 (P1 < P0), the real wage rate rises to W0/P1. It will be seen from panel (a) of Fig. 4.3 that at this higher real wage rate W0/P1, the smaller amount of labour N1 will be demanded and employed by all firms in the economy. However, at this higher wage rate W0/P1 (with money wage rate fixed at W0), RT number of workers are rendered unemployed. It is in this way that Keynes explained that with money wage rate remaining fixed at the level W0 and with flexible prices, the fall in aggregate demand results in persistent involuntary unemployment. Thus, by explaining the emergence of persistent involuntary unemployment Keynes made a fundamental departure from the classical view of a free market economy which denied the existence of involuntary unemployment except for a short time. WHAT CAUSES DEPRESSION AND INVOLUNTARY UNEMPLOYMENT: KENYES’S VIEW During 1929-33, capitalist economies found themselves in the grip of depression. Such was the severity of this depression that in the USA the rate of unemployment which was 3.2 per cent in 1929 shot up to 25% of the labour force in 1933. Besides, there was a drastic decline in Gross National Product (GNP) which fell from 315 billion dollars in 1929 to 222 billion dollars in 1933, that is, national income declined by 30 per cent during this four-year period. This reflects a dismal picture of the American economy during the period of Great Depression. In England as well as in other European countries also such a grave situation of severe recession and huge unemployment prevailed during this period. Before 1929-33 and even after it, recessions have occurred in these capitalist economies but they have not been as severe as that took place during 1929-33. Classical economists had no valid explanation of such a severe depression and large-scale cyclical unemployment of labour. A.C. Pigou and other economists of his view attributed this situation to the high wage rates kept by trade unions and Government. Pigou, therefore, suggested all-round cut in wages to increase employment and to remove depression and unemployment. However, this solution of the problem was neither logically sound nor practical to be implemented. Keynes challenged this view of the classical economists and put forward a different explanation of depression and cyclical unemployment which was accepted by many as logical and correct. He explained his viewpoint in his Fig. 4.4. What Causes Depression and Cyclical Unemployment : Keynes’s Explanationnow noted work, General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. He not only gave a sound and valid explanation of depression and its associated problem of cyclical unemployment but also suggested effective policy measures to cure them. According to Keynes, the cause of depression and cyclical unemployment in the industrialised capitalist countries was a sharp decline in private investment due to the adverse business expectations about profit-making. There was a wave of pessimism prevailing among investors. The decline in private investment due to fall in marginal efficiency of capital (that is, expected rate of return) caused a fall in aggregate demand and resulted in less than full-employment equilibrium. Consequently, level of output and employment fell drastically and involuntary unemployment came to prevail on a large scale. The involuntary unemployment that prevails in times of recession/depression is called cyclical unemployment and, according to Keynes, it is due to deficiency of aggregate demand. Large fluctuations in investment, according to Keynes, is due to the uncertain basis of profit expectations on which investment decisions are made. To quote him, “We have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimating the yield ten years hence of a railway, a copper mine, a textile factory, the goodwill of a patent medicine ... amounts to little and sometimes to nothing.”1 In view of this uncertainty of future. Keynes stressed that investment decisions were greatly influenced by how optimistic or pessimistic investors feel about making of profits from their investment. He used the term animal spirits to describe the pessimistic or optimistic expectations of the investors about profit-earning from investment projects. The term animal spirits implies that there may be no good or intelligent basis for expectations on which investors base their decisions. Thus involuntary unemployment emerges due to fall in aggregate demand brought about by decline in investment. Therefore, the cause of depression or cyclical involuntary unemployment is the deficiency of aggregate demand that results from adverse business expectations and loss of confidence of the investors in a market economy. It will be useful to explain through a diagram how a fall in investment causes a decline in level of output and employment and results in cyclical unemployment. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.4. It will be seen from Figure 4.4 (a) that due to adverse profit expectations or pessimism of investors, investment demand curve shifts to the left from II to I1I1. With this it will be seen that investment falls from I1 to I0 at a given rate of interest. This fall in investment demand by I1I0 causes a downward shift in the aggregate demand curve from AD to AD1 [See Fig. 4.4 (b)]. As a result, the equilibrium between aggregate demand and aggregate supply which was initially at full-employment level NF (which corresponds to point E where the two curves intersect) falls to the new equilibrium level of employment (ON1). Thus involuntary unemployment equal to NFN1 or ΔN emerges due to fall in aggregate demand. Therefore, the cause of Keynesian cyclical unemployment is deficiency of aggregate demand. It should also be noted, that the decline in the level of employment following the fall in investment and aggregate demand will also result in decrease in GNP or national income of a country. The emergence of large-scale unemployment and drastic decline in level of output and national income represents a situation of depression. It is also important to note that with the help of his theory of multiplier Keynes showed that the fall in the level of employment and income was much greater than that of decline in investment. This can be known by comparing decline in investment demand (ΔI) and fall in employment (ΔN) in Figure 4.4 (b). We shall discuss Keynes’s theory of income multiplier at length in a later chapter. 1. J.M. Kenyes, op. cit., pp 149-150. 90 Macroeconomics : Theory and Policy Explaining Great Depression (1929-33) : Monetarist View We have explained above Keynes’s view that great depression of 1929-33 was caused by fall in investment caused by the drastic fall in the profit expectations of business class. The decline in investment, according to him, caused aggregate demand to fall which along with the reverse working of multiplier caused conditions of depression (i.e., high rate of unemployment, substantial decrease in GNP and fall in prices). Keynes and his followers emphasise the role of fiscal policy (increase in Government expenditure and cut in taxation) to stimulate investment. They downplayed the role of monetary policy and in fact pointed out that monetary policy in the thirties during the depression period proved to be unimportant and ineffective. As a matter of fact, they asserted that monetary policy was tried during the depression period to revive the economy but miserably failed. At times of depression, according to them, businessmen are in the grip of pessimism about future profitability of investment and more money made available through easy and liberal monetary policy would not be effective in reviving the economy. It was in this context that some Keynesian economists remarked that ‘money does not matter’ and also referred to the failure of the policy of making more credit available for stimulating investment by businesses at times of depression—‘you can bring horse to water but cannot make it drink’s. Thus Keynesian view prevailed during the forties and fifties almost unchallenged. Keynes’s view was attacked by Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics, in the middle of fifties. Friedman and Schwartz in their important work, A Monetary History of the United States, written in 1963 quoted statistical evidence from the United States, and argued that “a re-examination of the Great Depression of the 1930s demonstrated that, contrary to general belief, it had been a tragic testament to the great power of monetary policy, not to its impotence’2. They pointed out that drastic decline in the quantity of money was made by Federal Reserve System (the Central Banks of the USA) from 1929 to 1933 which was responsible for severe depression in the American economy. They argued that the failure of the Federal Reserve System to prevent bank failures and the drastic decrease in money supply during 1930-1933 increased the intensity of depression. To quote them, “The US Federal Reserve System could have prevented the decline of one-third in the quantity of money that occurred from 1929 to 1933. Had it done so, the evidence indicated, the depression would have been far milder and briefer.”3 We thus see that Friedman and other monetarists emphasise monetary policy in causing depression. In fact, they go to the other extreme view ‘money alone matters’. However, in our view in recent recession during 2000-2003. The Federal Reserve System made successive cuts in rate of interest more than 7 times to revive the American economy without any success. For stimulating investment and growth, it cut the rate of interest even below 1 per cent, the lowest in the last 50 years but failed in its objective to overcome recession. Even in India Reserve Bank also lowered the bank rate, several times during 1998-2003 and reduced it to 6 per cent—the lowest in forty years—to bring about industrial recovery but it had also not much effect. In the case of the USA, the signs of recovery in the first quarter of 2003-04 seem to have been the result of drastic reduction in taxation to the extent of 3.5 billion dollars and huge increase in defence expenditure for war in Iraq. Both of these are fiscal policies suggested by Keynesians that seem to have worked to start a recovery in the American economy. To conclude, in the view of present author the truth lies in between the two extreme views of Keynes and Friedman. Therefore, modern economists give importance to both fiscal and monetary policies for influencing investment and growth in GNP. Both can be complements to each other Furthermore, profit expectations of entrepreneurs and cost and availability of credit play a significant role in determining national income, employment and price level in the economy. 2.
