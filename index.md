Telangana</span>- Telangana state would have been the second state for the
Telugu speaking people beside Andhra state as per the SRC recommendation but it
was not accepted in the Act. The Commission’s report judged the arguments for
and against the merger of the Telugu majority Telangana region (of Hyderabad
State) and the Andhra State (created in 1953). It was recommended that it will
be in the interests of Andhra as well as Telangana, if for the present, the
Telangana area is to constitute into a separate State, which may be known as
the Hyderabad State with provision for its unification with Andhra after the
general elections likely to be held in or about 1961 if by a two thirds
majority the legislature of the residency Hyderabad State expresses itself in
favor of such unification”. Hyderabad Chief Minister in his letter to Congress
President said Communist parties supported the merger for their political
calculations. Hyderabad PCC chief said overwhelming majority from Congress
party opposed the merger. In Hyderabad assembly more than two-third MLA’s
supported the merger and opposed the Fazal Ali Commission’s recommendation to
keep Telangana as a separate State for 5 years. An agreement was reached
between Telangana leaders and Andhra leaders on 20 February 1956 to merge
Telangana and Andhra with promises to safeguard Telangana’s interests. The
Gentlemen’s agreement of Andhra Pradesh was signed between Telangana and Andhra
leaders before the formation of the state of Andhra Pradesh in 1956. The
agreement provided safeguards with the purpose of preventing discrimination
against Telangana by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Following the
Gentlemen’s agreement, the central government established a unified Andhra
Pradesh on November 1, 1956. There have been several movements to invalidate
the merger of Telangana and Andhra, major ones occurring in 1969, 1972 and
2000s onwards. The Telangana movement gained momentum over decades becoming a
widespread political demand of creating a new state from the Telangana region
of Andhra Pradesh. In early 2014, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014
was approved by the Indian parliament, and Telangana became India’s 29th state
on 2 June 2014. The violations of this agreement are cited as one of the
reasons for formation of separate statehood for Telangana. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The Akali Dal, a Sikh-dominated political party active mainly in Punjab, sought
to create a Punjabi Subah province. This new state would be a Sikh-majority
state, which caused concern among the Punjabi Hindus. The Sikh leaders such
Fateh Singh tactically stressed the linguistic basis of the demand, while
downplaying its religious basis — a state where the distinct Sikh identity
could be preserved. The Hindu newspapers from Jalandhar, exhorted the Punjabi
Hindus to declare Hindi as their “mother tongue”, so that the Punjabi Subah
proponents could be deprived of the argument that their demand was solely
linguistic. The States Reorganization Commission rejected the demand for a
Punjabi-majority state saying that it lacked a majority support and that
Punjabi was not grammatically very distinct from Hindi. , Though the Patiala
and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) was merged with Punjab. Akali Dal
continued its movement, and in 1966 the Punjab Reorganisation Act split Punjab

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>An important aspect of the language
problem has been the status of minority languages. Unilingual states were not
possible in whatever manner their boundaries were drawn. Consequently, a large
number of linguistic minorities, that is, those who speak a language other than
the main or the official language of the state, continue to exist in
linguistically reorganized states. Overall nearly 18 per cent of India’s
population do not speak the official language of the states where they live as
their mother tongue. There is of course a great deal of variation among the
states on this count. According to the 1971 census, the percentages of
linguistic minorities to total population ranged from 4 in Kerala to 34 in
Karnataka, 3.9 in Assam to 44.5 in Jammu and Kashmir. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>From the beginning, the important point
to be decided upon was the status and rights of these minorities in their
states. On the one hand, there was the question of their protection, for there
was the ever-present danger of them being meted out unfair treatment, on the
other, there was the need to promote their integration with the major language
group of a state. A linguistic minority had to be given the confidence that it
would not be discriminated against by the majority and that its language and
culture would continue to exist and develop. At the same time, the majority had
to be assured that meeting the needs of the linguistic minority would not
generate separatist sentiments or demands and that the minorities would develop
a degree of state loyalty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>To confront this problem certain
fundamental rights were provided to the linguistic minorities in the
Constitution. For example, Article 30 states that ‘all minorities, whether
based an religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer
educational institutions of their choice’ and, more important, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘that the state shall not, in granting
aid to educational institutions discriminate against any educational
institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority,
whether based on religion or language.’ Article 347 lays down that on a demand
being made on behalf of a minority, the President may direct that its language
shall be officially recognized throughout the state or any part thereof for
such purposes as he might specify. The official policy since 1956, sanctioned
by a constitutional amendment in that year, has been to provide for instruction
in the mother tongue in the primary and secondary classes wherever there are
sufficient number of children to form a class. The amendment also provides for
the appointment of a Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities to investigate and
report regularly on the implementation of these safeguards. On the whole, the
central government has tended to play a very positive role in defence of the
rights of the minorities, but the implementation of the minority safeguards is
within the purview of the state governments and therefore differs from state to
state. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In general, despite some progress in
several states, in most of them the position of the linguistic minorities has
not been satisfactory. The constitutional safeguards have quite often been
inadequately enforced. The Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities has in his
reports regularly noted innumerable cases of discrimination against linguistic
minorities in matters of schooling, admission to technical and medical
institutions and employment in the state public services because of lack of
proficiency in the official language of the state. However, a redeeming feature
is that quite often facilities for primary education in the mother tongue of
the minorities have been provided, though these maybe inadequate in terms of
competent teachers and textbooks. But even here the big exception is the
all-round failure in the case of tribal minority languages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Moreover, an overwhelming majority of Muslims, India’s largest religious

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>While nearly all the major languages of
India were also the official languages of one state or the other, Urdu was not
the official language of any state except the small state of Jammu and Kashmir

Consequently, Urdu did not get official support in any part of the country. On
the contrary, it faced official discrimination and hostility both in U.P. and
Bihar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>We may briefly take up the case of U.P.,
though the position was no different in Bihar. The U.P. government decided
early on to declare Hindi as the only official language of the state; the
subterfuge was that Hindi and Urdu were not two separate languages and
therefore there was no need to make Urdu a second official language! In
practice, Urdu began to be abolished in many primary schools. Its use as a
medium of instruction was also increasingly limited. For example, in 1979-80,
only 3.69 per cent of primary school students received instruction in Urdu
while the number of Urdu speakers in 1981 was 10.5 per cent. The Hindi
protagonists also began to eliminate Urdu words from written Hindi. The neglect
of Urdu in the state led the well-known, left-wing Urdu critic, S. Ehtesham
Husain, to complain: ‘Urdu is being constantly termed as only an off-shoot or
variety of Hindi, a foreign language, a language of the Muslims, an instrument
of communal hatred and an enemy of Indian unity. All these contrary things are
said in the same breath, to suppress it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Urdu speakers, therefore, were persistent
in demanding that Urdu should be recognized as the second official language in
the states where it had a large presence, especially in U.P. and Bihar. The
U.P. government was equally consistent and successful in opposing the demand;
its main justification being that the States Reorganization Commission had recommended
that at least 30 per cent population in a state should speak a language before
it could be made the second official or regional language. Jawaharlal Nehru, in
particular, was very supportive of Urdu and critical of the anti-Urdu thinking
and activities of a large number of per-37<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indian culture and thought.’ He asked the chief minister of U.P. to declare
Urdu as a second official language in districts where it was widely used and in

when Nehru succeeded in persuading the U.P. government to agree to take certain
steps in this regard, they were nullified by laxity in their implementation.

giving legal sanctity to the rights granted to Urdu on the ground that such a
step might lead to communal riots. The governments of Andhra Pradesh and
Karnataka were more supportive of Urdu. In Andhra, Urdu has been recognized
since 1968 as an additional language for the Telengana region. And in both the
states, adequate facilities are provided for instruction through the medium of
Urdu in the primary stage and for instruction in Urdu at the higher school
stages. Two other aspects of Urdu’s position may be noted. First, unfortunately
the question of Urdu has got entangled with the communal question. While many
Muslims regard it as the language of their community as such, many Hindu
communalists are hostile to it because of their anti-Muslim ideological
position. Second, despite active hostility of many and official neglect, Urdu
continues not only to exist but even grow in terms of literary output, journals
and newspapers and especially as the language of films and television because
of its inherent vigour and cultural roots among the Indian people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The task of integrating the tribal people
into the mainstream was extremely complex, given the varied conditions under
which they live in different parts of the country, and their different
languages and distinct cultures. The 1971 census recorded over 400 tribal
communities numbering nearly 38 million people and constituting nearly 6.9 per
cent of the Indian population. Spread all over India, their greatest
concentration is in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, north-eastern India, West
Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Except in the North-East, they constitute
minorities in their home states. Residing mostly in the hills and forest areas,
in colonial India they lived in relative isolation, and their traditions,
habits, cultures and ways of life were markedly different from those of their
non-tribal neighbours. Nevertheless, except in the North-East, the two had for
centuries interacted culturally, socially, economically and politically. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In most parts of the country, colonialism
brought radical transformation of the tribals as their relative isolation was
eroded by the penetration of market forces and they were integrated with the
British and princely administrations. A large number of money-lenders, traders,
revenue farmers and other middlemen and petty officials invaded the tribal
areas and disrupted the tribals’ traditional way of life. They were
increasingly engulfed in debt and lost their lands to outsiders, often being
reduced to the position of agricultural labourers, sharecroppers and
rack-rented tenants. Many were forced to retreat further into the hills.
Belated legislation to prevent alienation of land by the tribal people failed
to halt the process. Verrier Elwin, who lived nearly all his life among the
tribal people in central and north-eastern India and who was one of the
formative influences in the evolution of the new government’s policies towards
the tribes, was to refer to the fate of the tribal people under British rule as
follows: ‘But now they suffered oppression and exploitation, for there soon
came merchants and liquor-venders, cajoling, tricking, swindling them in their
ignorance and simplicity until bit by bit their broad acres dwindled and they
sank into the poverty in which many of them still live today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Simultaneously, ‘missionaries were
destroying their art, their dances, their weaving and their whole culture.’
Colonialism also transformed the tribals’ relationship with the forest. They
depended on the forest for food, fuel and cattle feed and raw materials for
their handicrafts. In many parts of India the hunger for land by the immigrant
peasants from the plains led to the destruction of forests, depriving the
tribals of their traditional means of livelihood. To conserve forests and to
facilitate their commercial exploitation, the colonial authorities brought
large tracts of forest lands under forest laws which forbade shifting
cultivation and put severe restrictions on the tribals’ use of the forest and their
access to forest products. Loss of land, indebtedness, exploitation by
middlemen, denial of access to forests and forest products, and oppression and
extortion by policemen, forest officials, and other government officials was to
lead to a series of tribal <span class=0Text>38</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The preservation of the tribal people’s
rich social and cultural heritage lay at the heart of the government’s policy
of tribal integration. As Jawaharlal Nehru, the main influence in shaping the
government’s attitude towards the tribals put it: ‘The first problem we have to
face there (in the tribal areas) is to inspire them (the tribal people) with
confidence and to make them feel at one with India, and to realize that they
are part of India and have an honoured place in it.’ At the same time, ‘India
to them should signify not only a protecting force but a liberating one.’
Indian nationalism, Nehru thought, was capable of accommodating the uniqueness
of the tribal people. There were two major approaches regarding the place to be
accorded to tribals in Indian society. One approach was to leave the tribal
people alone, uncontaminated by modern influences operating outside their world
and to let them stay more or less as they were. The second approach was that of
assimilating them completely and as quickly as possible into the Indian society
all around them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The disappearance of the tribal way of
life was not to be regretted; it was to be welcomed for that would represent
their ‘upliftment.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Jawaharlal Nehru rejected both these
approaches. The first approach, of treating the tribal people ‘as muse-um
specimens to be observed and written about,’ was, he said, ‘to insult them.’
The tribal people, he wrote, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘could not be left cut off from the world
as they were.’ Isolation was in any case impossible at this stage, <span
class=0Text>40</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>for the process of penetration by the
outside world had already gone too far and ‘it was not possible or desirable to
isolate them.’ The second approach of allowing them ‘to be engulfed by the
masses of Indian humanity,’ or of their assimilation through the operation of
normal outside forces was also wrong, according to Nehru. This would lead to
the loss of the tribals’ social and cultural identity and of the many virtues
they possessed. In fact, he pointed out, ‘if normal factors were allowed to
operate, unscrupulous people from outside would take possession of tribal lands
… and forests and interfere with the life of the tribal people.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>This would also ‘upset their whole life
and culture, which had so much of good in them.’ Instead of these two
approaches, Nehru favoured the policy of integrating the tribal people in
Indian society, of making them an integral part of the Indian nation, even
while maintaining their distinct identity and culture. There were two basic
parameters of the Nehruvian approach: ‘the tribal areas have to progress’ and
‘they have to progress in their own way’. Progress did not mean ‘an attempt
merely to duplicate what we have got in other parts of India.’ Whatever was
good in the rest of India would ‘be adopted by them gradually.’ Moreover,
whatever changes were needed would be ‘worked out by the tribals themselves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The problem was how to combine these two
seemingly contradictory approaches. Nehru stood for economic and social
development of the tribal people in multifarious ways, especially in the fields
of communication, modern medical facilities, agriculture and education. In this
regard, he laid down certain broad guidelines for government policy. First, the
tribals should develop along the lines of their own genius; there should be no
imposition or compulsion from outside. The non-tribals should not approach them
with a superiority complex. Rather, the understanding should be that they had
an equal contribution to make to the evolution of the common culture and social
and political life of the country. Second, tribal rights in land and forests
should be respected and no outsider should be able to take possession of tribal
lands. The incursion of the market economy into tribal areas had to be strictly
controlled and regulated. Third, it was necessary to encourage the tribal
languages which ‘must be given all possible support and the conditions in which
they can flourish must be safeguarded.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Fourth, for administration, reliance
should be placed on the tribal people themselves, and administrators should be
recruited from amongst them and trained. As few as possible outsiders should be
introduced as administrators in tribal areas and they should be carefully
chosen. They should have a sympathetic and understanding approach, and should
not consider themselves superior to or apart from the tribal people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>They should be prepared to share their
life with the tribal people among whom they work. Fifth, there should be no
over-administration of tribal areas. The effort should be to administer and
develop them through the tribals own social and cultural institutions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Nehru’s approach was in turn based on the
nationalist policy towards tribals since the twenties when Gandhiji set up
ashrams in the tribal areas and promoted constructive work. After independence
this policy was supported by Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, and
other major political leaders. To give shape to the government’s policy, a
beginning was made in the Constitution itself which directed under Article 46 <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>that the state should promote with
special care the educational and economic interests of the tribal people and
should protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation,
through special legislation. The governors of the states in which tribal areas
were situated were given special responsibility to protect tribal interests,
including the power to modify central and state laws in their application to
tribal areas, and to frame regulations for the protection of tribals’ right to
land and also their protection from moneylenders. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The application of the fundamental rights
was amended for this purpose. The Constitution also extended full political
rights to the tribal people. In addition, it provided for reservation of seats

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

setting up of Tribal Advisory Councils in all states containing tribal areas to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>governments created special facilities
and organized special programmes for the welfare and development of the tribal
areas and the tribal people including the promotion of cottage and village
industries and generation of employment among them. Large expenditures were
undertaken and large sums set apart in the Plans for the purpose. The funding
for tribal welfare significantly increased after 1971. In spite of the
constitutional safeguards and the efforts of the central and state governments,
the tribals’ progress and welfare has been very slow, and even dismal. Except
in the North-East, the tribals continue to be poor, indebted, landless and
often unemployed. The problem often lies in weak execution of even
well-intentioned measures. Quite often there is a divergence between the
central and the state government policies, the latter being less in tune with
tribal interests. In particular, state governments have been relatively
ineffective in administering the positive policies and laws laid down by the
central government or by the state governments themselves, as repeatedly shown
by the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and in the
reports of the Planning Commission. Quite often the funds allocated for tribal
welfare are not spent or are spent without corresponding results, or are even
misappropriated. One of the watchdogs of tribal interests, the Tribal Advisory
Councils, have not functioned effectively. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Often the administrative personnel are
ill-trained or even prejudiced against tribals. But sympathetic officials are
also known to be quickly transferred out of tribal areas under the pressure of
traders, moneylenders, forest contractors and land-grabbers. A major handicap
from which tribals suffer is denial of justice, often because of their
unfamiliarity with the laws and the legal system. Laws preventing transfer of
land to outsiders have continued to be evaded, leading to alienation of land
and eviction of tribal. Rapid extension of mines and industries has worsened
their conditions in many areas. While deforestation proceeds apace through the
cooperation of corrupt officials and politicians with forest contractors, the
tribals’ traditional right of access to the forest and its produce is
continuously curtailed. Forest laws and regulations are also used by
unsympathetic and often corrupt forest officials to harass and exploit the
tribal people. As a result of loss of land, deforestation and restrictions on
the access to the forest, the tribal people have been facing growing
unemployment and have been increasingly driven into more inaccessible stretches
of hills and jungles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The progress of education among the
tribal people has been disappointingly slow. In many areas, primary education
through the tribal languages has taken place, but in others the state
governments have tended to neglect tribal languages and education through their
medium. Tribal society almost everywhere has also been gradually developing
class differences and a class structure with those belonging to the upper crust
often joining forces with the upper crust of the outsiders. Further, the major
gains of whatever development takes place in the fields of education,
employment in administration, economy and political patronage are reaped by the
small segment of the tribal elites which has slowly emerged and grown. On the
whole, though there are a few danger signals, certain positive developments in
the tribal sphere have occurred since 1947. Legislation to protect tribal
rights and interests, activities of the tribal welfare departments, Panchayati
Raj, spread of literacy and education, reservations in government services and
in higher educational institutions, and repeated elections have led to
increasing confidence among the tribal people and greater political
participation by them—or at least by the growing middle classes and intelligentsia
among them—in the constitutional political processes. They are now insisting on
a greater and more active political role for themselves, and acquiring
increasing representation in different political structures and institutions.
Above all, they are demanding a greater share in national economic development.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Protest movements have sprung up among
tribals out of their frustration with the lack of development and welfare.
These are bound in time to produce positive results. The government policy has usually
been conciliatory, through not necessarily successful in redressing tribal
grievances. But some of the protest movements have taken to violence, leading
to strong state action against them. Little ground has been gained by them,
though they have often dramatically drawn national attention to the tribal
condition. The growing tribal antagonism towards the non-tribal people or
outsiders living in tribal areas has been another unfortunate development.
Undoubtedly, some of the outsiders like traders, moneylenders, landlords and
government officials have been a scourge of the tribal areas, but, over
decades, many other outsiders—<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all tribal areas outside the North-East. The mass of the tribals and
non-tribals are equally poor and have a common interest in economic and social
development as also social and economic justice. Besides, most of the middleclass
non-tribals, including many of the traders and industrialists, do perform
useful economic functions in the tribal areas. Any undue antagonism and
antipathy between the tribals and non-tribals would be inimical and even
dangerous to both. It is no longer true that the only relationship that can
exist between the two is an exploitative one. Tribals cannot expect to revert
to isolation from their non-tribal neighbours or to prevent massive interaction
with them, including their in-migration. In fact, the two can protect and
promote their interests only through mutual cooperation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

consisting of over hundred groups, speaking a wide variety of languages and
living in the hill tracts of Assam, shared many of the features and problems of
the tribal people in the rest of the country. But their situation was different
in several respects. For one, they constituted the overwhelming majority of the
population in most of the areas they inhabited. Then, non-tribals had not
penetrated these areas to any significant extent, though economic contacts
between the tribal and the nontribal areas had been developing over time. This
was because of the British policy in the late nineteenth century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The tribal areas occupied by the British
then formed part of the Assam province but were given a separate administrative
status. Their socio-political structure was not disturbed and a deliberate
policy of excluding the outsiders from the plains was followed. In particular,
no non-tribal plainsmen were allowed to acquire land in the tribal areas
because of which the tribals suffered little loss of land. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

permitted and even encouraged the Christian missionaries to move in and establish
schools, hospitals and churches and to proselytise, thus introducing change and
modern ideas among some of the tribal youth. The missionaries, in turn,
collaborated with the colonial authorities and helped keep the nationalist
influence out of the tribal areas, besides encouraging their isolation from the
rest of the population of Assam and India. Infact, immediately after
independence, some of the missionaries and other foreigners even promoted
sentiment in favour of separate and independent states in north-eastern India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The virtual absence of any political or
cultural contact of the tribals in the North-East with the political life of
the rest of India was also a striking difference. As we have seen in an earlier
chapter, a powerful factor in the unification of the Indian people as a nation
was the common bonds forged in the course of the anti-imperialist struggle. But
this struggle had little impact among the tribals of the North-East. To quote
Jawaharlal Nehru: ‘The essence of our struggle for freedom was the unleashing
of a liberating force in India. This force did not even affect the frontier
people in one of the most important tribal areas.’ And again: ‘Thus they never
experienced a sensation of being in a country called India and they were hardly
influenced by the struggle for freedom or other movements in India. Their chief
experience of outsiders was that of British officers and Christian missionaries
who generally tried to make them anti-Indian.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sixth Schedule of the Constitution which applied only to the tribal areas of

judicial functions within the overall jurisdiction of the Assam legislature and

to enable tribals to live according to their own ways. The Government of India
also expressed its willingness to further amend the constitutional provisions
relating to the tribal people if it was found necessary to do so with a view to
promote further autonomy. But this did not mean, Nehru clarified that the

implemented best of all in the North-East Frontier Agency or NEFA, which was
created in 1948 out of the border areas of Assam. NEFA was established as a Union
Territory outside the jurisdiction of Assam and placed under a special
administration. From the beginning, the administration was manned by a special
cadre of officers who were asked to implement specially designed developmental
policies without disturbing the social and cultural pattern of the life of the
people. As a British anthropologist who spent nearly all his life studying the
tribal people and their condition wrote in 1967, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘A measure of isolation combined with a
sympathetic and imaginative policy of a progressive administration has here
created a situation unparalleled in other parts of India.’ NEFA was named
Arunachal Pradesh and granted the status of a separate state in 1987. While
NEFA was developing comfortably and in harmony with the rest of the country,
problems developed in the other tribal areas which were part of Assam
administratively. The problems arose because the hill tribes of Assam had no
cultural affinity with the Assamese and Bengali residents of the plains. The
tribals were afraid of losing their identities and being assimilated by what
was, with some justification, seen to be a policy of Assimilation. Especially
distasteful to them was the attitude of superiority and even contempt often
adopted by non-tribals working among them as teachers, doctors, government
officials, traders, etc. There was also a feeling among them that the Assamese
government failed to understand them and tended to neglect their interests.
This feeling represented not so much the reality as the failure of the
political leadership of Assam to redress tribal grievances in time and with
deep concern. Soon, resentment against the Assam government began to mount and
a demand for a separate hill state arose among some sections of the tribal
people in the mid-fifties. But this demand was not pressed with vigour; nor did
the Government of India encourage it, for it felt that the future of the hill
tribes was intimately connected with Assam though further steps towards greater
autonomy could be envisaged. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>But the demand gained greater strength
when the Assamese leaders moved in 1960 towards making Assamese the sole
official language of the state. In 1960, various political parties of the hill
areas merged into the All Party Hill Leaders Conference (APHLC) and again demanded
a separate state within the Indian union. The passage of the Assam Official
Language Act, making Assamese the official language of the state, and thus the
refusal of the demand for the use of the tribal languages in administration,
led to an immediate and strong reaction in the tribal districts. There were
hartals and demonstrations, and a major agitation developed. In the 1962
elections, the overwhelming majority of the Assembly seats from the tribal
areas were won by the advocates of a separate state, who decided to boycott the
State Assembly. Prolonged discussions and negotiations followed. Several
commissions and committees examined the issue. Finally, in 1969, through a
constitutional amendment, Meghalaya was carved out of Assam as ‘a state within
a state’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

law and order which remained a function of the Assam government. Meghalaya also
shared Assam’s High Court, Public Service Commission and Governor. Finally, as
a part of the reorganization of the North-East, Meghalaya became a separate
state in 1972, incorporating the Garo, Khasi and Jaintia tribes.
Simultaneously, the Union Territories of Manipur and Tripura were granted
statehood. The transition to statehood in the case of Meghalaya, Manipur,
Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh was quite smooth. Trouble arose in the case of
Nagaland and Mizoram where secessionist and insurrection-ary movements
developed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN> The Nagas were the inhabitants of the Naga Hills along the North-East
frontier on the Assam-Burma border. They numbered nearly 500,000 in 1961,
constituted less than 0.1 per cent of India’s population, and consisted of many
separate tribes speaking different languages. The British had isolated the
Nagas from the rest of the country and left them more or less undisturbed
though Christian missionary activity was permitted, and which had led to the
growth of a small educated stratum. Immediately after independence, the
Government of India followed a policy of integrating the Naga areas with the
State of Assam and India as a whole. A section of the Naga leadership, however,
opposed such integration and rose in rebellion under the leadership of A.Z.
Phizo, demanding separation from India and complete independence. They were
encouraged in this move by some of the British officials and missionaries. In
1955, these separatist Nagas declared the formation of an independent
government and the launching of a violent insurrection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Government of India responded with a
two-track policy in line with Jawaharlal Nehru’s wider approach towards the
tribal people discussed earlier in this chapter. On the one hand, the
Government of India made it clear that it would firmly oppose the secessionist
demand for the independence of Naga areas and would not tolerate recourse to
violence. Towards a violent secessionist movement it would firmly follow a
policy of suppression and non-negotiations. As Nehru put it, ‘It does not help
in dealing with tough people to have weak nerves.’ Consequently, when one
section of the Nagas organized an armed struggle for independence, the
Government of India replied by sending its army to Nagaland in early 1956 to
restore peace and order. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>On the other hand, Nehru realized that
while strong and quick military action would make it clear that the rebels were
in a no-win situation, total physical suppression was neither possible nor
desirable, for the objective had to be the conciliation and winning over of the
Naga people. Nehru was wedded to a ‘friendly approach’. Even while encouraging
the Nagas to integrate with the rest of the country ‘in mind and spirit’; he
favoured their right to maintain their autonomy in cultural and other matters.
He was, therefore, willing to go a long way to win over the Nagas by granting
them a large degree of autonomy. Refusing to negotiate with Phizo or his
supporters as long as they did not give up their demand for independence or the
armed rebellion, he carried on prolonged negotiations with the more moderate,
nonviolent and non-secessionist Naga leaders, who realized that they could not
hope to get a larger degree of autonomy or a more sympathetic leader to settle
with than Nehru. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In fact, once the back of the armed
rebellion was broken by the middle of 1957, the more moderate Naga leaders
headed by Dr Imkongliba Ao came to the fore. They negotiated for the creation
of the State of Nagaland within the Indian union. The Government of India
accepted their demand through a series of intermediate steps; and the State of
Nagaland came into existence in 1963. A further step forward was taken in the
integration of the Indian nation. Also, politics in Nagaland since then
followed, for better or worse, the pattern of politics in the other states of
the union. With the formation of Nagaland as a state the back of rebellion was
broken as the rebels lost much of their popular support. But though the
insurgency has been brought under control, sporadic guerilla activity by Naga
rebels trained in China, Pakistan and Burma and periodic terrorist attacks
continue till this day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

the Naga situation. Even though the record of the Indian army in Nagaland has
been on the whole clean, especially if the difficult conditions under which
they operate are kept in view, it has not been without blemish. Its behaviour
has been sometimes improper and in rare cases even brutal. Too many times
innocent people have suffered. But then it has also paid a heavy price through
the loss of its soldiers and officers in guerilla attacks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN> A situation similar to that in Nagaland developed few years later in
the autonomous Mizo district of the North-East. Secessionist demands backed by
some British officials had grown there in 1947 but had failed to get much
support from the youthful Mizo leadership, which concentrated instead on the
issues of democratization of Mizo society, economic development and adequate
representation of Mizos in the Assam legislature. However, unhappiness with the
Assam government’s relief measures during the famine of 1959 and the passage of
the Act in 1961, making Assamese the official language of the state, led to the
formation of the Mizo National Front (MNF), with Laldenga as president. While
participating in electoral politics, the MNF created a military wing which
received arms and ammunition and military training from East Pakistan and
China. On March 1966, the MNF declared independence from India, proclaimed a
military uprising and attacked military and civilian targets. The Government of
India responded with immediate massive counter-insurgency measures by the army.
Within a few weeks the insurrection was crushed and government control
restored, though stray guerilla activity continued. Most of the hard core Mizo
leaders escaped to East Pakistan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

some renewed strength in the late seventies but was again effectively dealt
with by Indian armed forces. Having decimated the ranks of the separatist

peace. A settlement was finally arrived at in 1986. Laldenga and the MNF agreed
to abandon underground violent activities, surrender before the Indian
authorities along with their arms, and re-enter the constitutional political
stream. The Government of India agreed to the grant of full statehood to
Mizoram, guaranteeing full autonomy in regard to culture, tradition, and land
laws, etc. As a part of the accord, a government with Laldenga as chief
minister was formed in the new State of Mizoram in February 1987. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN> Jharkhand, the tribal area of Bihar consisting of the Chota Nagpur and
the Santhal Parganas, has for decades spawned movements for state autonomy. In
this area are concentrated several major tribes of India, namely Santhal, Ho,
Oraon and Munda. Unlike traditional tribes, nearly all of these practice
settled plough agriculture on the basis of family farms. Economic differentiation
has set in; there are a significant number of agricultural labourers and a
growing number of mining and industrial workers. The land-holding pattern among
tribals is as unequal and skewed as among non-tribals. A large class of
moneylenders has also developed among them. The tribal society in Jharkhand has
increasingly become a class-divided society. Most of tribals practise two
formal religions—Hinduism and Christianity. The Jharkhand tribes, however,
share some features with other Indian tribes. They have lost most of their
land, generally to outsiders, and suffer from indebtedness, loss of employment
and low agricultural productivity. They organized several major rebellions
during the nineteenth century; and many of them actively participated in the national
movement after 1919. In 1951, the Scheduled Tribes constituted 31.15 per cent
of the population in Chota Nagpur (30.94 in 1971) and 44.67 per cent of the
population in the Santhal Parganas (36.22 in 1971). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Thus, nearly two-thirds of Jharkhand’s
population in 1971 was non-tribal. The overwhelming majority of both tribals
and non-tribals were equally exploited poor peasants, agricultural labourers
and mining and industrial workers. Inequality in land-holding and the
moneylender menace were equally prevalent among the two as was the
commercialization of agriculture and commercial activity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>With the spread of education and modern
activity in the tribal areas, a movement for the formation of a separate tribal
state of Jharkhand, incorporating Chota Nagpur and the Santhal Parganas of
South Bihar and the contiguous tribal areas of Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West
Bengal, started during the late thirties and forties. Realizing that the
interests of the tribal people could be best promoted and their domination by
non-tribals ended if they had a state of their own within the Union of India,
the Jharkhand party was founded in 1950 under the leadership of the
Oxford-educated Jaipal Singh. The party achieved a remarkable success in 1952
elections when it won 32 seats in Chota Nagpur and emerged as the main
opposition party in the Bihar Assembly. It won 25 seats in 1957. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>But the Jharkhand party faced a major
dilemma. While it demanded a state where the tribal people would predominate,
the population composition of Jharkhand was such that they would still
constitute a minority in it. To overcome this problem the party tried to give
its demand a regional character by opening its membership to the non-tribals of
the area and underplaying its anti-non-tribal rhetoric, even while talking of
the empowerment of tribals and their dominance of the new state. The States
Reorganization Commission of 1955, however, rejected the demand for a separate
Jharkhand state on the ground that the region did not have a common language.
The central government also held that tribals being a minority in Jharkhand
could not claim a state of their own. By the early sixties the rank and file of
the party began to get disheart-ened and frustrated. The Jharkhand party could
win only 20 seats to the Bihar Assembly in 1962. In 1963, a major part of the
leadership of the party, including Jaipal Singh, joined Congress, claiming that
by ‘working from within Congress’ it stood a better chance of getting its
demand for a separate state accepted by the government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Several tribal parties and movements
developed in Jharkhand after 1967, the most prominent being the Jharkhand Mukti
Morcha (JMM), which was formed in late 1972. The JMM revived the demand for the
Jharkhand state, but it made two innovations. It recognized the hard reality
that nearly two-thirds of the population of Jharkhand was non-tribal and that;
therefore, a movement which appealed only to the tribal people could not
acquire the requisite political strength. The JMM, therefore began to assert that
all the <span class=0Text>46</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

whether tribal or non-tribal, were exploited, discriminated against and
dominated by North Bihar and the recent migrants. It, therefore, put forward
the demand for a separate state as a regional one on behalf of the peasants and
workers of the region. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Concentrating on economic issues, it also
acquired the support of the nontribal poor; several non-tribal leaders and
political activists joined it, though the bulk of its following was still that
of tribals. The tribal leaders felt that despite the minority character of
tribals in the projected Jharkhand state, they would have a far greater
representation and weight in the new state than they had in Bihar as a whole. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The JMM turned to a radical programme and
ideology. Joined by other groups, especially leftist groups such as the Marxist
Coordination Centre, it organized several militant agitations on issues such as
recovery of alienated land, moneylenders’ exploitation, employment of tribals in
mines and industries and improved working conditions and higher wages in the
latter, police excesses, high-handedness of forest officials and increasing
liquor consumption. Shibu Soren emerged as the charismatic leader of the JMM
during the early seventies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Cooperation with the leftists did not,
however, last long; nor did the tribal/non-tribal alliance. The movement for
the Jharkhand state underwent constant ups and downs and splits over the years
with new groups coming up every so often. Major differences among the Jharkhand
leaders pertained to the question of cooperation or alliance with the main
all-India parties. Many of them believed that in parliamentary democracy, a
small number of MPs or MLAs could not on their own easily get their demands accepted.
Shibu Soren, his followers and some others were also aware of the futility of
permanently confronting state power and the inevitable recourse to violence and
armed struggle as advocated by the movement’s ultra-leftist fringe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The movement also found it difficult to
shift completely from tribal to class-based regional politics, since it was
basically built around tribal identity and tribal demands. In particular, the
policy of reservations for tribals contained the continuing seeds of
differences between tribals and non-tribals. Tribal society was also not
homogeneous; it also contained landlords, rich peasants, traders and
moneylenders. Above all, the maximum the movement was able to extract from the
ruling parties in Bihar and the Centre was a promise of regional autonomy
within the Bihar state for the Jharkhand region. In fact, as of today, the
various constituents of the Jharkhand movement have also accepted the regional
autonomy formula, with differences existing only in regard to its exact form and
content. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

her distinct regional identity—of being a Tamil or a Punjabi, a Bengali or a
Gujarati—without being any the less proud of being an Indian, or being hostile
to people from other regions. This was put very well by Gandhiji in 1909: ‘As

nation has proved to be quite successful in accommodating and even
celebrating—in Nehru’s words—India’s cultural diversity. The different areas of
India have had full cultural autonomy and been enabled to fully satisfy their
legitimate aspirations. The linguistic reorganization of India and the

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>From the beginning, the national
government felt a responsibility to counter this imbalance in regional
development. Thus, for example, the 1956 Industrial Policy Resolution of the
Government of India asserted that ‘only by securing a balanced and coordinated
development of the industrial and agricultural economy in each region can the
entire country attain higher standards of living.’ Similarly, recognizing ‘the
importance of regional balance in economic development as a positive factor in
promoting national integration,’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

urged that ‘a rapid development of the economically backward <span class=0Text>48</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

priority in national and State plans, at least to the extent that the minimum
level of development is reached for all states within a stated period.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>From the beginning, the central
government adopted a whole range of policies to influence the rates of growth
in poorer states and regions so as to reduce their economic distance from the
richer states and regions. A major government instrument in bringing this about
was the transfer of financial resources to the poorer states. Important in this
respect was the role of the Finance Commission, provided for in the
Constitution and appointed periodically by the President. The Commission
decides the principles on which disbursement of central taxes and other
financial resources from the central government to the states occurs. Various
Financial Commissions have tried not only to do justice among the states but
also to reduce inter-state disparity by giving preferential treatment to the
poorer states, by allocating larger grants to them than their population would
warrant and by transferring resources from the better-off states to them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Planning was also seen as powerful
instrument that could be used to remove regional inequality. The Second Plan
reflected this objective and it was reiterated in the succeeding Plans. The
Third Plan explicitly stated that ‘balanced development of different parts of
the country, extension of the benefits of economic progress to the less
developed regions and widespread diffusion of industry are among the major aims
of planned development.’ For this purpose, the Planning Commission allocated
greater plan assistance to the backward states. This assistance is given in the
form both of grants and loans on the basis of a formula which assigns an
important place to the degree of backwardness of a state. Moreover, bias in
favour of backward states in the devolution of resources from the Centre to the
states, in the form both of financial and plan transfers, has tended to
increase with time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Public investment by the central
government in major industries such as steel, fertilizers, oil refining,
pet-rochemicals, machine-making, heavy chemicals and in power and irrigation
projects, roads, railways, post offices and other infrastructural facilities
has been a tool for the reduction of regional inequality. India has relied
heavily on public investment since the beginning of the Second Plan in 1957 and
an effort has been made to favour backward states in regard to this investment.
In the planning and location of the public sector enterprises balanced regional
growth has been an important consideration, though this has entailed a certain
economic cost to the enterprises concerned. Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have
gained the most from such investment; Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and
Kashmir and the north-eastern states have also benefitted a great deal from the
development of infrastructure, especially roads. Government incentives have
been provided to the private sector to invest in backward areas through
subsidies, tax concessions, and concessional banking and institutional loans at
subsidised rates. The system of licensing of private industrial enterprises,
which prevailed from 1956 to 1991, was also used by the government to guide
location of industries in backward areas. Following nationalization of banks in
1969, the expansion of the network of their branches was used to favour
backward areas. Banks and other public sector financial institutions were
directed to promote investment in these areas. Also, various ministries have
evolved schemes for development of backward areas. In particular, poverty
eradication programmes, such as the Food for Work programme and the Intensive
Rural Development programme, adopted since the seventies, and to some extent
education, health and family planning programmes and the public distribution
system have favoured poorer states. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>One sector where the principle of the
reduction of regional disparity has not been kept in view is that of investment
in irrigation and subsidies to agricultural development. This has been
especially so since the sixties when the Green Revolution began and investment
in rural infrastructure and technological innovation was concentrated in Punjab,
Haryana and western U.P., namely areas where irrigation was or could be made
available readily. In particular, investment in and development of rain-fed dry
land agriculture was neglected. The result was an increase in regional
agricultural disparity. The spread of the Green Revolution technology during
the seventies to Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, eastern U.P. and parts
of Rajasthan, and during the eighties to the eastern states of Bihar, West
Bengal, Orissa and Assam has redressed the regional imbalance to a certain
extent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

migration of unskilled labour from the backward regions and of skilled labour

migration from one state to another. Some states—<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Maharashtra have benefitted from in-migration. Certain other states, like
Punjab and Karnataka have had the benefit of both out-migration and
in-migration. Unfortunately, as we shall see in the next section, efforts have
been made by some states to put checks on inter-state migration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>It would be appropriate here to ask how
far have the various efforts of the national government succeeded in reducing
regional inequality. The picture that emerges is a mixed one. There has been a
marginal improvement but regional inequality especially in terms of per capita
income, continues to remain a prominent feature of the Indian economy.
Possibly, the situation would have been much worse but for the government’s
actions which has prevented the widening of the economic gap between states and
regions. There are also other dimensions to be observed with regard to the
impact of these policies. For one, there has certainly been a decline in
inter-state industrial disparity, especially in the organized manufacturing
sector. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>There is also less disparity in terms of social
welfare as represented by life expectancy, infant mortality and literacy,
though a few states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu have moved far ahead. As we have
seen above, the increased disparity in agriculture is also gradually getting
redressed though the rain-fed dry areas are still lagging behind. While the
percentage of people below the poverty line has steadily declined in all the
states it is in the advanced states that maximum progress has been made, so
that the inter-regional disparity in the distribution of poverty has been
growing. Overall, while there has been economic growth in all states, the rates
of growth of different states have been highly differential, leading to
inter-state disparities remaining quite wide. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Some backward states have managed to pick
themselves up, while others have failed to do so, with the result that there
has been a change in the hierarchy of states in terms of development and per

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Thus, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa
are still at the bottom. Maharashtra, Punjab and Gujarat continue to remain on
the top. There has been an improvement in the position of the previously
underdeveloped states of Haryana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, while there has
been deterioration in that of Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and U.P, with U.P.
moving to the bottom level and West Bengal to the middle. Andhra Pradesh and
Rajasthan have stagnated, remaining just above the bottom level. On the whole,
Haryana is an example of the states which have improved their position and
Bihar of one of those whose position has worsened. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Why then does regional inequality persist
on such a wide scale? What are the constraints on its decline? Or why have
Bihar and U.P. performed so poorly. It emerges that the constraint is not
essentially of geography, that is, of inequality in size or natural resources.
Bihar, U.P. and Orissa are, for example, very well endowed by nature; their
people well known for their industriousness because of which they are welcomed
in the rest of the country, and indeed overseas in the West Indies, Mauritius
and Fiji to where some have migrated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The major reason, at the all-India level,
for continuing regional disparity has been the low rate of economic growth. To
make a dent on this requires a high rate of national growth so that large
revenues can be raised and devoted to the development of the backward regions
without adversely affecting national growth itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The rate of growth of the Indian economy
was around 3.5 per cent till the end of seventies and around 5 per cent in the
eighties. This was not high enough to have a significant impact on regional
inequality despite policies consciously designed to favour backward regions
being followed. It is only in the last few years that the rate of growth of the
economy has touched 7 per cent, while population growth has also slowed down. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>A reduction in economic inequality may
come about, provided the right type of regional developmental policies continue
to be followed. Some states’ backwardness lies in their socio-economic and political
organization itself. For example, the agrarian structure in Bihar and eastern
U.P. is quite regressive and in many parts of these states land reforms have
been inadequately implemented. (This was also true of Orissa till recently.)
The feudal mentality is still quite strong. Also, in Bihar and Orissa land
consolidation has been tardy, which played an important role in the
agricultural development of Punjab and Haryana. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The backward states have a lower level of
infrastructural facilities, such as power, irrigation, roads, telephones, and
modern markets for agricultural produce. These are essential for development
and have to be developed by the states themselves being mostly State subjects.
States also have a low level of social expenditure on education and public
health and sanitation, which are also State subjects. Besides, they suffer from
a lack of financial resources to meet plan expenditure. Increased central
financial assistance is unable to offset this weakness. A vicious cycle is set
up. A low level of economic development and production means less financial
resources and limited expenditure on infrastructure, development planning and
social services. And this low level of expenditure in turn leads to low levels
of production and therefore of financial resources. Political and
administrative failure also bolsters backwardness. Bihar and U.P. are classic
cases of states, bedevilled by high levels of corruption, sheer bad
administration, and deteriorating law and order. As a result whatever central
assistance is available is poorly utilized and often diverted to
non-development heads of expenditure. Further, development of infrastructure,
including roads and electricity, is neglected and the existing infrastructure
is riddled with inefficiency and corruption. All this turns away the private
sector, which is a major source of development in the advanced states. The role
of greater administrative efficiency is also proved by the better rates of
economic growth in the relatively better administered states of south and
western India as compared to Bihar and U.P. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>In passing, it maybe mentioned that
disparities in development also exist within each state. In many cases, this
inequality has become a source of tension and given birth to sub-regional
movements for separate states within the Indian union, or greater autonomy for
the sub-regions within the existing states, or at least special treatment and
safeguards in matters of employment, education and allocation of financial
resources. Examples of such sub-regional feelings are the movements in
Telengana in Andhra Pradesh, Vidarbha in Maharashtra, Saurashtra in Gujarat,
Chhattisgarh in Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bun-delkhand in U.P.,
Darjeeling district or Gorkhaland in West Bengal, Bodoland in Assam, to a
certain extent South Bihar or Jharkhand in Bihar, and the areas consisting of
the old princely states of Orissa. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Undoubtedly, regional economic inequality
is a potent time-bomb directed against national unity and political stability.
So far, fortunately, it has been ‘digested’, absorbed and mitigated because it
is not the result of domination and exploitation of backward states by the more
advanced states or of discrimination against the former by the national government.
It is noteworthy that the politically important Hindi-speaking states of the
Indian heartland—U.P., Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, with nearly 37 per
cent of the seats in the Lok Sabha—are economically backward. On the other
hand, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra, with only about 17 per cent of
the seats in the Lok Sabha, are the high-income states. It is, therefore,
impossible for anyone who talks of the Hindi-belt states’ domination of the
others to be taken seriously. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>On the other hand, the backward
Hindi-belt states wield so much political clout that it is impossible for them
to accuse the central government or non- Hindi states of dominating or
discriminating against them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>It is interesting that so far accusations
of central domination have come from the relatively developed states of Punjab
and West Bengal—obviously for political and not economic reasons. In the
all-India services too, like the IAS, the Hindi areas are not advantaged. It is
Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal which have a higher representation
than their population warrants. Another reason for the lack of regionalism and
feeling of discrimination among the poorer states has been the consciousness of
their intelligentsia that their poverty and backwardness are basically the
result of the actions of their own political and administrative classes. After
all, feelings of deprivation and lack of progress are essentially articulated
by the intelligentsia. At the same time, the vast majority of the people in the
poorer states are blissfully unaware of their backwardness and poverty in
comparison with other states. This leads both to absence of discontent with
their position as also to a lack of effort to reach equality with the more
advanced states. However, with the spread of education and the reach of the
visual and print media, such as television and newspapers, this state of
affairs is likely to change. Nevertheless, as was fully realized by the
founders of the Republic, it is necessary to first contain regional inequality
within politically and economically reasonable and acceptable limits and then
to gradually move toward its elimination, by raising the rates of growth of the
poorer states by all available means including greater central assistance as
also greater self effort by them. This also, of course, means that, as Ajit
Mazumdar has argued, the national government needs to wield ‘greater <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>doctrine. Underlying it is the view that
a state specifically belongs to the main linguistic group inhabiting it or that
the state constitutes the exclusive ‘homeland’ of its main language speakers
who are the ‘sons of the soil’ or the ‘local’ residents. All others, who live
there, or are settled there and whose mother tongue is not the state’s main
language, are declared to be ‘outsiders’. These ‘outsiders’ might have lived in
the state for a long time, or have migrated there more recently, but they are
not to be regarded as ‘the sons of the soil’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

newly-created employment and educational opportunities was the outcome. In the
struggle for the appropriation of economic resources and economic
opportunities, often recourse was taken to communalism, casteism and nepotism.

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘outsiders’ from the economic life of a
state or city. The problem was aggravated in a number of cities or regions
because the speakers of the state language were in a minority or had a bare
majority. For example, in Bombay, in 1961, the Marathi-speakers constituted
42.8 per cent of the population. In Bangalore, the Kannada-speakers were less
than 25 per cent. In Calcutta, the Bengalis formed a bare majority. In the
urban areas of Assam, barely 33 per cent were Assamese. After 1951 the rate of
migration into the cities accelerated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

why did ‘the sons of the soil’ movements develop in some states and cities and
not in others, why were they directed against some migrants and linguistic
minority groups and not others, why were some types of jobs targeted and not
others, why, technical and professional education as against the so-called arts
education? Conflict between migrants and non-migrants (and linguistic
minorities and majorities) was not inherent and inevitable. In general, the two
have lived harmoniously in most of the states. Clearly, there were specific
conditions that precipitated the conflict. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mainly arisen, and have been more virulent, when there is actual or potential
competition for industrial and middle-class jobs, between the migrants and the
local, educated, middle-class youth. The friction has been more intense in
states and cities where ‘outsiders’ had greater access to higher education and
occupied more middle-class positions in government service, professions and
industry and were engaged in small businesses, such as small-scale industry and
shopkeeping. Active in these movements have also been members of the
lower-middle class or workers, as well as rich and middle peasants whose
position is unthreatened, but who increasingly aspire to middle-class status
and position for their children. All these social groups also aspire to give
their children higher education, especially technical education, such as

This was not of course inevitable. The Communist party refused to use
anti-migrant sentiments in Calcutta because of its ideological commitment, one

Similarly, though Congress may have taken an op-portunist and compromising
stand when faced with major ‘sons of the soil’ movements, it has not initiated
or actively supported them. ‘Outsiders’ have been often far more numerous in

the ‘locals’ when there has been large-scale migration of labourers from Bihar

jute and other mills of Calcutta, or of workers from Bihar and Orissa to the
tea plantations in Assam and Bengal, or of Oriya building workers to Gujarat,
and domestic workers all over India. Such migrations have not posed a threat to
the local middle classes; and in the last case—that of the domestic workers—the
middle classes have been the chief beneficiaries as also promotees of the
migration. However, more recently, because of the higher salaries and education

emergence or non-emergence of anti-migrant movements in an area or region has
been the existence or nonexistence of a tradition of migration. When people of

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>movements have flourished in Maharashtra,
Assam and the Telengana area of Andhra Pradesh, the people of which have not
had a tradition of migration. The Indian Constitution is to some extent
ambiguous on the question of the rights of the migrants. Article 15 prohibits
any discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of
birth. Article 16 prohibits discrimination in the employment or appointments to
any office under the state on grounds of ‘descent, place of birth or
residence’. However, the parliament, though not any state legislature, can pass
a law laying down the requirement of residence within a state for appointments
under that state. Under political pressure and taking advantage of the
ambiguity in the Constitution, many states, in fact reserve jobs, or give
preference for employment in state and local governments and for admission into
educational institutions to local residents. The period of residence is fixed
or prescribed in such cases. Also, while the Constitution permits reservation
or preference in state jobs only on grounds of residence and not language, some
state governments have gone further and limited the preference to those local
residents whose mother tongue is the state language. They have thus
discriminated against long-term migrants, their descendants, and even the
residents who can speak the state language but whose mother tongue is a
minority language in the state. This has, of course, been in clear violation of
the Constitution. Many state governments have also given directions to private
employers to give preference to local persons for employment in their
enterprises. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

reservation in employment and education for the local persons has been that in
the states concerned they are socially, economically and educationally backward
and are not able to compete with the more advanced migrant communities. Also,
in technical colleges and universities, the more backward local students would
be overwhelmed by the more advanced students from other states. It is because
of this, in the post-Nehru era, even the central government has tended to
support preference for residents of a state in employment in central public sector
enterprises below the level of a certain technical expertise and in colleges
and universities. Reservations on grounds of residence have also been approved
by the courts. However, as brought out earlier, reservations for the tribal
people are in a separate category. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

militant,, and often violent movement against the South Indians, especially the
Tamils, who were declared to have a disproportionate share of office jobs such
as clerks and typists in private firms and small businesses such as tea shops

when it organized arson against South Indians, looted and destroyed their
tea-stalls and eating places, overturned cars of Tamils and tore off Tamil
signs from shops. The Shiv Sena could not, however, sustain its hate-South
Indian campaign or become a major political force outside Bombay city or get
the support of any all-India political party. Gaining a wider political

‘the sons of the soil’ doctrine is still somewhat a minor one and there is no
ground for pessimism on that score. Even at its height, only a few cities and
states were affected in a virulent form, and at no stage did it threaten the
unity of the country or the process of nation-in-the-making. Besides, its
effects on the Indian economy have been negligible: migration within the
country has not been checked; inter-state mobility is in fact growing. But the

permitting full cultural autonomy to different linguistic areas. Hindi and

that a strong state should not be mistaken for an authoritarian one. A strong
national government does not entail weak state governments or a national
government that rides roughshod over the federal provisions of the

non-dominating national government which observes the federal features of the

experienced an advance towards the basic objectives of democracy, civil

course, some discontent among the intelligentsia regarding the slow pace of
development, especially with regard to the problems of poverty and employment,
and the slow and unsatisfactory progress of land reforms. Among the several
areas of progress and achievement, though marked by certain weaknesses and

parliamentary debates. The Opposition too played its part by respecting the
parliament and its procedures, functioning without fear in its portals, and
keeping the standard of parliamentary debates at a high level. Moreover,
parliamentary committees such as the Estimates Committee began to play an
important role as critics of, and watchdogs over, the government

opposition parties, though small numerically, were able to take advantage of
the fact that the Congress was not a monolithic party and encompassed within
itself several political and ideological trends. They were able to influence
the government policies by influencing the different ideological strands in the
Congress. Nehru also respected and promoted internal democracy and debate
within the Congress party and encouraged it to accommodate new social forces
and trends. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Federalism, provided for in the
Constitution, also was established as a firm feature of Indian polity during
the Nehru years, with a genuine devolution of power to the states. Respecting
the states’ autonomy, Nehru would not impose decisions on the state governments
or interfere with their policies, though he took care to inform them of his own
thinking and occasionally advise or even insist on their acceptance of a
particular policy. He also permitted the state Congress parties to choose their
party and government leaders. He relied upon the state leaders and governments
to understand better their own intricate problems. In the process, he was
willing to put up with a great deal. In fact, one reason why Nehru would not go
too far in forcing the states to effect land reforms the way he conceived them
was because land reforms were a State subject and he would not ride roughshod
over the states’ rights and powers even for a favourite cause of his. Nehru
would guide and advise and urge but would not step out of constitutional
boundaries; he would observe constitutional niceties in spirit and form. In
fact, a major reason for the weaknesses of the agricultural, educational,
health and other social welfare programs lay in the Centre’s dependence on the
states for their implementation, for these were State subjects. At the same
time, Nehru did not permit any weakening of the prestige or authority of the
central government. He always maintained a sharp distinction between
centralization of power or Centre’s domination of the states and a strong
Centre needed for nation building and maintenance of the unity and independence
of the country as also to keep under check disruptive and divisive forces. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>A major reason that led to the
development of harmonious relations between the Centre and the states and which
kept in check centrifugal forces was the fact that the same party ruled in both
places. The leading role of the Centre was also facilitated by the fact that
some of the tallest men and women in Indian politics held office in the Cabinet
as well as the Congress Working Committee. The tradition of the supremacy of
the civil government over the armed forces was fully established during these
years. The Indian armed forces had been traditionally non-political and had
accepted civilian control and leadership. But the continuation of this role by
them was not guaranteed. Nehru, in particular, was worried about the
possibility of the armed forces intervening in politics and the government in
case of exceptional circumstances, as happened in nineteenth century France and
Germany and recently in many Third World countries. To avoid such a possibility
in India he took several steps in this regard. He kept the size of the armed
forces relatively small; refusing to permit their expansion even after
large-scale US military aid to Pakistan began in 1954. The expenditure on the
defence forces was also kept extremely low, less than two per cent of the
national income. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Immediately after independence, it was to
be decided whether the government of independent India should carry on with the
administrative structure and machinery inherited from the colonial regime and
‘designed to serve the relatively simple interests of an occupying power.’ The
kingpin of this structure was the Indian Civil Service (ICS). If the structure
was to be replaced or overhauled, the beginning had to be made with the ICS.
Initially, there were differences in approach to the question between Nehru and
Patel, who, as Home Minister, dealt directly with the administrative services.
Nehru was a staunch critic of the ICS and bureaucracy as a whole not only
because of their colonial ancestry but also because of their basic
conservatism. In 1946, he had described the existing administrative structure
as ‘the ship of State’ which was ‘old and battered and slow-moving and unsuited
to this age of swift change.’ He declared that ‘it will have to be scrapped and
give place to another.’ Patel, on the other hand felt that retention of the
existing administrative machinery was necessary in the then troubled times when
it seemed that internal stability was in danger and chaos imminent. He was not
in favour of a sudden discontinuity and vacuum in administration, particularly
as the ICS and other all-India services provided the only trained personnel
available. Defending the all-India services in the Constituent Assembly in
1949, Patel said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Para1 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>‘I have worked with them during this difficult
period … Remove them and I see nothing but a picture</span><span class=0Text><span
lang=EN style='font-weight:normal'> </span></span><span lang=EN>of chaos all
over the country’. Further: ‘If during the last two or three years most of the
members of</span><span class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-weight:normal'> </span></span><span
lang=EN>the Services had not behaved patriotically and with loyalty, the Union
would have collapsed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Nehru accepted Patel’s position, though
grudgingly, for he too realized that there was no alternative to reliance on
the existing all-India services if a breakdown of administration was to be
avoided. Over time he too began to rely heavily on these services, admiring
their administrative efficiency, especially as he realized that the other
available human resources were rather poor. Many, following Lenin in the State
and Revolution, have argued that the existing state administrative apparatus
should have been ‘smashed’ or dismantled and that it was perhaps quite easy to
do so in the very beginning of a new state. We think that in light of India’s
and other countries’ historical experience there is little doubt that having
well-trained, versatile and experienced civil services at the outset when the
country was in turmoil was a distinct asset and advantage to India; and that
they did give a good account of themselves in the troubled post-Partition
years. However, while retention of the existing bureaucracy and the
administrative structure was inevitable and perhaps even sound under the
circumstances, the failure to ‘rebuild and transform their character’ was
clearly a liability. The administrative structure had been built during the
colonial period largely to maintain law and order and to collect land revenue.
It had to be overhauled, however gradually, to suit the needs of a democratic
and developing society and made capable of executing the new economic and
social welfarist policies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Nehru in particular was fully aware of
the inadequacy of the existing bureaucracy to understand the problems of the
people and to implement the new tasks. As early as 1951 he complained: ‘We rely
more and more on official agencies which are generally fairly good, but which
are completely different in outlook and execution from anything that draws
popular enthusiasm to it.’ He was convinced that the situation could be
remedied in two ways: ‘One, by educating the whole machine. Secondly, by putting
a new type of person where it is needed.’ But neither of two steps was actually
taken. Rather, the new IAS was formed very much in the old ICS mould and this
pattern was followed all down the bureaucratic structure. For example, the few
who joined the Community Development projects out of idealism and social
commitment were soon frustrated when they discovered that they were being
dominated, looked down upon and treated as low-paid underlings by the
traditional, higher bureaucrats. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

improve over the years, it deteriorated further becoming more inefficient and
inaccessible. The attitude of the bureaucracy, especially the police, towards
the people and their problems also became increasingly unhelpful. Above all,
there was the evil of corruption. There were major signals in the Nehru era
that political and administrative corruption was beginning to burgeon. In the
fifties, however, the tentacles of corruption were not yet far-reaching and
checks existed in the form of a political leadership and cadres having roots in
the freedom struggle and Gandhian ethos, a large, honest bureaucracy,
especially in its middle and higher rungs, and a judiciary having a high level
of integrity It was, therefore, still possible to squash the evil with a
certain ease. Nehru and other leaders were aware of the problems relating to
public administration. In May 1948, Nehru drew the attention of the chief
ministers to complaints from the public ‘about our inefficiency, inaccessibility,
delays and, above all, of corruption,’ and added: ‘I fear that many of these
complaints are justified.’ Similarly, in his last letter to the chief ministers
in May 1963, he pointed to the need to ‘strengthen our Government apparatus and
to fight a ceaseless war against corruption and inefficiency.’ And he added:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

critical role that scientific research and technology would play in India’s
defence. As part of the effort to promote self-sustaining scientific and
technological growth, the foundation stone of India’s first national
laboratory, the National Physical Laboratory, was laid on 4 January 1947. This
was followed by the setting up during the Nehru years of a network of seventeen
national laboratories, specializing in different areas of research. To
emphasize the importance of science and scientific research, Nehru himself

personnel. This became a major factor in the brain drain of scientists that
began in the late fifties. India was one of the first nations to recognize the
importance of nuclear energy. Nehru was convinced that nuclear energy would
bring about a global revolution in the social, economic and political spheres,
besides affecting nations’ defence capabilities. In August 1948, the Government
of India set up the Atomic Energy Commission with Homi J. Bhabha, India’s
leading nuclear scientist, as chairman, in the Department of Scientific
Research, which was under Nehru’s direct charge, to develop nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes. In 1954, the government created a separate Department of
Atomic Energy under the prime minister with Homi Bhabha as Secretary. India’s
first nuclear reactor in Trombay, Bombay, also the first in Asia, became
critical in August 1956. Her on-going and fairly well advanced nuclear
programme included the setting up of several nuclear plants to produce
electricity in a few years time. Though India was committed to the peaceful
uses of nuclear power, its nuclear capacity could easily have been used to
produce the atomic bomb and other atomic weapons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

up the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) in 1962 and
established a Rocket Launching Facility at Thumba (TERLS). Krishna Menon, as
Defence Minister, took steps to initiate defence research and development.
Steps were also taken to increase India’s capacity in production of defence
equipment so that India gradually became self-sufficient in its defence needs.
India also changed over to decimal coinage and a metric system of weights and
measures, despite dire warnings that an illiterate population could not handle
the change. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Republic went beyond national integration and political stability. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Indian society had to move towards social
change. Article 36 of the Constitution in the section on the Directive
Principles of State Policy stated: ‘The state shall strive to promote the
welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as may be a
social order in which justice, economic and political, shall inform all
institutions of the national life.’ This conception of the new social order was
encompassed in 1955 by the phrase ‘socialistic pattern of society’ officially
accepted by the Congress at its Avadi Session and later incorporated as its
objective in the Second and Third Five Year Plans. Consequently, several
important measures of social reforms, which some have described as the
beginning of a welfare state, were taken during the Nehru years. Very important
measures in this respect were those of land reforms, the initiation of planned
economic development and rapid expansion of the public sector. In addition
far-reaching labour legislation was undertaken, including recognition of
collective bargaining, the right to form trade unions and to go on strike,
security of employment and provision of health and accident insurance. There
were also moves towards a more equitable distribution of wealth through
progressive and steep income-tax and excise tax policies. Expansion of
education and health and other social services, was also sought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Nehru and other leaders were also keen to
ensure that Indian social organization underwent change, leading to the social
liberation of the hitherto socially backward and suppressed sections of
society. As Nehru put it in 1956: ‘We have not only striven for and achieved a
political revolution, not only are we striving hard for an economic revolution
but … we are equally intent on social revolution; only by way of advance on
these three separate lines and their integration into one great whole, will the
people of India progress.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The Constitution had already incorporated
a provision abolishing untouchability. The government supplemented this
provision by passing the Anti-Untouchability Law in 1955 making the practice of
untouchability punishable and a cognizable offence. The government also tried
to implement the clauses of the Constitution regarding reservations in
educational institutions and government employment in favour of Scheduled
Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) and other weaker sections of society.
Other necessary measures were taken to raise their social status, such as the
provision of special facilities in the form of scholarships, hostels
accommodation, grants, loans, housing, health care and legal-aid services. A
Commissioner of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was appointed to monitor
the effective implementation of all such measures and constitutional
provisions. However, in spite of all these steps, the SCs and STs continued to
be backward and caste oppression was still widely prevalent, especially in
rural areas, where <span class=0Text>59</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
also formed a large part of the landless agricultural labour, and therefore
also suffered from class oppression. There was also hardly any effort to
eradicate the ideology of the caste system or to remove caste inequality and
caste oppression so that casteism began to spread from the upper castes to the
backward castes and from the rural to the urban areas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Participating actively in the national
movement for years, women’s groups and organizations were demanding revision of
laws regarding women’s rights in the family, and in Nehru they had a firm
supporter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Already, before independence, Nehru had
made his position on this issue clear and quoted Charles Fourier, the French
philosopher: ‘One could judge the degree of civilization of a country by the
social and political position of its women.’ A major step forward in this
direction was taken when the Hindu Code Bill was moved in the parliament in
1951. The bill faced sharp opposition from conservative sectors of society,
especially from Jan Sangh and other Hindu communal organizations. Even though
actively supported by the vocal members of Congress party and women MPs and
other women activists, Nehru decided to postpone enactment of the bill in order
to mobilize greater support for it. He was, however, firm in his determination
to pass the bill and made it an issue in the elections of 1951-52. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>After coming back to power, the
government passed the bill in the form of four separate acts which introduced
monogamy and the right of divorce to both men and women, raised the age of
consent and marriage, and gave women the right to maintenance and to inherit
family property. A revolutionary step was thus taken for women’s liberation,
though its practice would take decades to take full effect. An important
lacu-na in this respect was that a uniform civil code covering the followers of
all religions was not enacted. This would have involved changes in Muslim
personal law regarding monogamy and inheritance. There was strong opposition to
this from the Muslim orthodoxy. The process of social reform among Muslims had
in the modern period lagged far behind that among Hindus and consequently
social change had been quite slow even among middle-class Muslim women. Nehru
was not willing to alarm the Muslim minority which was, he believed, even
otherwise under pressure. He would make changes in Muslim personal law and
enact a uniform civil code but only when Muslims were ready for it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The founding fathers were fully aware of
the need for better and wider education as an instrument of social and economic
progress, equalization of opportunity and the building up of a democratic
society. This was all the more urgent because in 1951 only 16.6 per cent of the
total population was literate and the percentage was much lower, being only 6
per cent, in the case of rural families. To remedy this situation, the
Constitution directed that by 1961 the state should provide free and compulsory
education to every child up to the age of fourteen. Later, this target was
shifted to 1966. The government provided large sums for developing primary,
secondary, higher and technical education: while the expenditure on education
was Rs 198 million in 1952-52, by 1964-65 it had increased to Rs 1462.7
million, i.e. by more than seven times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Since education was primarily a state
subject, Nehru urged the state governments not to reduce expenditure on primary
education, whatever the nature of financial stringency. If necessary, he
suggested, even expenditure on industrial development could be reduced. He told
the National Development Council in May 1961: ‘I have come to feel that it
(education) is the bases of all and, on no account unless actually our heads
are cut off and we cannot function, must we allow education to suffer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

boys and tripled for girls. From 1950-51 to 1965-66 the number of boys enrolled
in classes I to V increased from 13.77 million to 32.18 million. The relevant
figures for girls were 5.38 million and 18.29 million. The progress was equally
rapid in case of secondary education. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Between 1950-51 and 1965-66 enrolment

eighteen universities with a total student enrolment of nearly 300,000. By
1964, the number of universities had increased to fifty-four, the number of
colleges to about 2,500 and the number of undergraduate and post-graduate
students, excluding intermediate students, to 613,000. The number of girls
students increased six-fold and constituted 22 per cent of the total. However, <span

12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>the progress in primary education, though
recognizable, did not match the needs or the intentions especially as the
number of eligible students was growing fast because of the high rate of
population growth. The constitutional target of free and compulsory education

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

of the Third Plan in 1965-66 only 61 per cent of the children between six and
fourteen were in school, the figure for girls being only 43 per cent.
Consequently, widespread illiteracy continued; as late as 1991 only 52 per cent
of the Indians were literate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>But these figures do not tell the full
story. In 1965, five per cent of the rural population was not served by any
school at all. Moreover, the facilities provided in the existing schools were
very poor, with majority of schools having no pucca building, blackboards or
drinking water. Nearly 40 per cent of primary schools had only one teacher to
take three or four classes. A particular malady of primary schooling was the
high rate of dropouts. Nearly half of those enrolled in class I would have left
school by the time they reached class IV and been rapidly reduced to virtual
illiteracy again. Moreover, the dropout rate was higher in case of girls than
the boys. Clearly, there was no equal opportunity in education and therefore
also hardly any equalization of opportunity in work and employment for the poor
and those in the rural areas who constituted the vast majority of the Indian
people. A major weakness that crept in was the decline in educational
standards. Despite recognition of the problem, except for the technology
sector, the educational system was left untouched and unreformed and the
quality of education continued to deteriorate, first in schools and then in
colleges and universities. The ideological content of education also continued
to be the same as in the colonial period. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Nehru was aware of the unsatisfactory
progress in education and near the end of his prime ministership began to put
greater emphasis on its development, especially of primary education, which, he
now stressed, should, be developed at any cost. ‘In the final analysis’, he
wrote to the chief ministers in 1963, ‘right education open to all is perhaps
the basic remedy for most of our ills.’ Also, ‘In spite of my strong desire for
the growth of our industry, I am convinced that it is better to do without some
industrial growth then to do without adequate education at the base. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Two major programmes for rural uplift,
namely, the Community Development programme and Panchayati Raj, were introduced
in 1952 and 1959. They were to lay the foundations of the welfare state in the
villages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Though designed for the sake of
agricultural development, they had more of a welfare content; their basic
purpose was to change the face of rural India, to improve the quality of life
of the people. The Community Development programme was instituted on a limited
scale in 1952 covering 55 development blocs, each bloc consisting of about 100
villages with a population of sixty to seventy thousand. By the mid-sixties
most of the country was covered by a network of community blocs, employing more
than 6,000 Block Development Officers (BDOs) and over 600,000 Village Level
Workers (VLWs or Gram Sewaks) to help implement the programme. The programme
covered all aspects of rural life from improvement in agricultural methods to
improvement in communications, health and education. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The emphasis of the programme was on
self-reliance and self-help by the people, popular participation and
responsibility. It was to be basically a people’s movement for their own
welfare. As Nehru stated at the very outset of the programme in 1952, the basic
objective was ‘to unleash forces from below among our people.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>While it was ‘necessary to plan, to
direct, to organize and to coordinate; but it [was] even more necessary to
create conditions in which a spontaneous growth from below [was] possible.’
While material achievements were expected, the programme was much more geared
‘to build up the community and the individual and to make the latter a builder
of his own village centre and of India in the larger sense.’ ‘The primary
matter is the human being involved,’ he added. Another major objective was to
uplift the backward sections: ‘We must aim at progressively producing a measure
of equality in opportunity and other things.’ In 1952 and in the later years,
Nehru repeatedly referred to the Community Development programme and the accompanying
National Extension Service as representing ‘new dynamism’ and a ‘great
revolution.’ and as ‘symbols of the resurgent spirit of India.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>The programme achieved considerable
results in extension work: better seeds, fertilizers, and so on, resulting in
agricultural development in general and greater food production, in particular,
construction of roads, tanks and walls, school and primary health centre
buildings, and extension of educational and health facilities. Initially, there
was also a great deal of popular enthusiasm, which, however, petered out with
time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>It soon became apparent that the
programme had failed in one of its basic objectives—that of involving the
people as full participants in developmental activity. Not only did it not stimulate
self-help, it increased expectations from and reliance on the government. It
gradually acquired an official orientation, became part of the bureaucratic
framework and came to be administered from above as a routine activity with the
BDOs becoming replicas of the traditional sub-divisional officers and the
Village Level Workers becoming administrative underlings. As Nehru put it later
in 1963, while the entire programme was designed to get the peasant ‘out of the
rut in which he has been living since ages past,’ the programme itself ‘has
fallen into a rut.’ The weaknesses of the programme had come to be known as
early as 1957 when the Balwantrai Mehta Committee, asked to evaluate it, had
strongly criticized its bureaucratization and its lack of popular involvement.
As a remedy, the Committee recommended the democratic decentralization of the
rural and district development administration. On the Committee’s
recommendation, it was decided to introduce, all over the country, an integral
system of democratic self-government with the village panchayat at its base.
The new system, which came to be known as Panchayati Raj and was implemented in
various states from 1959, was to consist of a three-tier, directly elected
village or gram panchayats, and indirectly elected bloc-level panchayat samitis
and district-level zila Parishads. The Community Development programme was to
be integrated with the Panchayati Raj; considerable functions, resources and
authority were to be devolved upon the three-tiered samitis to carry out
schemes of development. Thus, the Panchayati Raj was intended to make up a
major deficiency of the Community Development programme by providing for
popular participation in the decision-making and implementation of the
development process with the officials working under the guidance of the
three-level samitis. Simultaneously, the countryside was covered by thousands
of cooperative institutions such as cooperative banks, land mortgage banks and
service and market cooperatives, which were also autonomous from the
bureaucracy as they were managed by elected bodies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Nehru’s enthusiasm was once again aroused
as Panchayati Raj and cooperative institutions represented another radical step
for change in society. They would transfer responsibility for development and
rural admininistrations to the people and accelerate rural development. They
would thus let as instruments for the empowerment of the people and would not
only lead to greater self-reliance, but would also act as an educative tool,
for bringing about a change in the outlook of the people. Above all, they would
initiate the process of creating better human beings. However, these hopes were
belied. Though adopting Panchayati Raj in one form or another, the state
governments showed little enthusiasm for it, devolved no real power on the
Panchayati samitis, curbed their powers and functions and starved them of
funds. The bureaucracy too did not slacken its grip on rural administration at
different levels. Panchayats were also politicized and used by politicians to
gather factional support in the villages. As a result, though foundations of a
system of rural local self-government were laid, democratic decentralization as
a whole was stunted and could not perform the role assigned to it by the
Balwantrai Mehta Committee and Jawaharlal Nehru. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN>Moreover, the benefits of community
development, new agricultural inputs and the extension services were mostly
garnered by the rich peasants and capitalist farmers, who also came to dominate
the Panchayati Raj institutions. The basic weakness of the Community
Development programme, the Panchayati Raj and the cooperative movement was that
they ignored the class division of the rural society where nearly half the
population was landless or had marginal holdings and was thus quite powerless.
The village was dominated socially and economically by the capitalist farmers
and the rich and middle peasantry; and neither the dominant rural classes nor
the bureaucrats could become agents of social transformation or popular participation.</span></p>
