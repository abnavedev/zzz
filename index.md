These reforms will build on a series of transformative reforms rolled out by the Government in last several years. These reforms in gas sector will further deepen and spur the economic activities in the following areas: • The whole eco-system of policies relating to production, infrastructure and marketing of natural gas has been made more transparent with a focus on ease of doing business. • These reforms will prove very signifi cant for Aatmanirbhar Bharat by encouraging investments in the domestic production of natural gas and reducing import dependence. • These reforms will prove to be another milestone in moving towards a gas-based economy by encouraging investments. • The increased gas production consumption will help in improvement of environment. • These reforms will also help in creating employment opportunities in the gas consuming sectors including MSMEs. • The domestic production will further help in increasing investment in the downstream industries such as City Gas Distribution and related industries. 

The Road Ahead

When the road is rough, a fi rm control over brake and accelerator determines how smooth the ride would be. The same holds true for the unprecedented situation we are in. It began with a complete lockdown, to contain the pandemic and ensure better preparedness, and now with the series of unlocks, the economic activities are gradually gaining momentum. The tradeoff is between accelerating economy and applying brake to control the pandemic. Monetary and fi scal measures taken in this direction are important for this road to recovery. Though, infl ation, employment scenario and the ongoing health crisis will continue to cast a shadow for a while. International cues especially the progress on the vaccine front will decide by when the international travel can resume, businesses can revitalise, offi ces can resume with full workforce, and economy embraces the new normal way of functioning. The reforms and stimulus under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative aim to strengthen and reboot various sectors. Based on the pillars of Economy, Infrastructure, System, Demography and Demand, the reforms resolve to provide impetus to sectors and areas which have noticed sluggish movement. The Aatmanirbhar Bharat Package includes wide-ranging interventions such as direct benefi t transfer, food security, rural jobs under MGNREGS, Credit Guarantee schemes for MSMEs and Kisan Credit Card Scheme. To infuse money into the economy and boost consumption, the Government has taken various measures including the LTC Cash Voucher scheme and Festival advance to the central government employees. The extent of support in comparison with the rest of the world suggests India’s intervention is wide-ranging, pragmatic and catering to the localised needs. The Principal Economic Adviser in the lead article of this Special issue has elucidated on the “Barbell” strategy used in fi nancial markets – i.e. hedge fi rst for the worst possible outcome while progressing step-by-step with updating of information and has compared it with the strategy devised in India to combat the impact of pandemic and the rationale behind it. The issue discusses in detail various monetary measures to consolidate the state of economy. It also brings out the possibility of changing landscape of industries and businesses with certain businesses losing relevance while bringing new opportunities to some service and tech-based sectors. Efforts to develop a multi-dimensional and multi-scalar response that acknowledges the contribution of migrants in the economy of cities have been highlighted. India is uniquely placed in terms of demographic dividends. Over 62% people in the country fall in the age group of 15-59 years which is expected to rise up to 65% by 2035. Job losses due to the pandemic are a grim reality. The current situation has certainly devastated a large section of the working population. But, there has been a growing trend towards efforts to increase employment opportunities. The recent announcement by the Government regarding creation of National Recruitment Agency is likely to be a game changer in terms of streamlining and standardising the processes. It is important to focus on advancement of skills in line with the emerging economic realities of the market. Given this, there is a need for the government and private sector to work together to address skill gaps and link supply with demand and vice-versa. Equipped with the right skills to meet the emerging demand of the new industrial era, the youth will be the torchbearers of India’s march to becoming a self-reliant nation. Agriculture has already demonstrated its potential to revive the pandemic-hit economy. To sustain agricultural growth and boost rural economy in post-Covid era, it is critical to have a robust infrastructure in place to support farm and farm-processing based activities. Midst the slump, agriculture has shown a bright spot. Being an agrarian economy, agriculture is the core sector which generates employment. Spurring the rural economic growth can give new direction to the economy. This edition of Yojana seeks views and opinions of experts to assess the current economic situation, its impact on various sectors and the road that lies ahead.

Preparing India for an Uncertain Post-Covid World Sanjeev Sanyal The world has just experienced the biggest shock since World War II. The immediate response is well underway. Based on a “barbell strategy”, India’s economic and health response has been somewhat different than that of other countries in terms of sequencing and emphasis of various measures. The long-term response, however, is aimed at making the Indian economy more resilient and flexible in order to deal with the opportunities and problems of the post-Covid world. he world economy experienced a major crisis there had been a major outbreak in Wuhan, China, and that in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

After all, it would have been difficult to predict in 1940 that British and French colonial empires would collapse within a decade, that global geo-politics would be dominated for half a century by a US–USSR Cold War, that man would set foot on the moon, and that televisions would become everyday items. So, how can one prepare for an uncertain new world? Rather than invest in a rigidly master-planned response, it is better to invest in two things: flexibility and resilience. This is the context in which recent supply-side reforms need to be seen. Even a cursory look at recently announced structural reforms would show that they have one thing in common- an attempt to encourage flexibility and adaptation in India’s economy. The agriculture sector reforms free-up farmers to sell their produce as they wish while those involved in the supply chain can invest in storage without and even deficit monetisation. Indian media and academics fear of being labeled “hoarders”. This will allow the farm tend to be excessively critical of monetisation. This is sector and farm-related industries to adapt their activities dogma.

By the same token, when the interest rate falls, people can get money easily and can spend more. The cost and availability of money are the instruments of monetary policy. To draw a parallel, the instruments of fi scal policy are taxes and expenditure. Within this broad mandate, the conduct of monetary policy in India has undergone several design alterations over the years, broadly mirroring the changes that have occurred globally, while adapting to national needs. Since 2016, as enshrined in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act amended in that year, India’s monetary policy framework underwent a change and a new framework described as fl exible infl ation targeting or FIT was instituted. Under this framework, the primary objective of monetary policy is to achieve an infl ation rate of 4 percent, while keeping in mind the objective of growth. There are several notable features of FIT. First, the infl ation rate is defi ned as year-on- year changes (in percent) in the consumer price index (CPI) that is compiled and released to the a period of time. These aspects – a band rather than a public every month by the National Statistical Offi ce point target; the achievement of the target over a period (NSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme of time rather than at all times; and the specifi cation Implementation (MoSPI). It is an all-India index and of ‘keeping in mind the objective of growth’ – are the combines both rural and urban price changes. In view fl exible elements of FIT. of the fact that the Indian economy is subjected to Second, the defi nition of the target in terms of the frequent supply shocks, such as those associated with CPI is noteworthy. The CPI measures prices paid by the vagaries of monsoons or international crude price consumers at the retail level. Thus, it captures prices shifts due to production changes by the Organisation that the common person faces on a regular basis and by of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) over which doing so, it relates the conduct of monetary policy to national authorities have no control, a tolerance band everyday life. The average consumer is aware of these has been prescribed around the infl ation target of 4 prices since they impinge on their daily life through the percent. A lower tolerance limit is set cost of living. For people working at 2 percent and an upper tolerance Since 2016, as enshrined in the in the organised sector, their salaries limit is at 6 percent. The target and and wages are ‘indexed’ to the CPI Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act the tolerance limits are specifi ed so that whenever the CPI increases by the Government of India (GoI), amended in that year, India’s by a specifi ed amount, they are given providing an example of monetary- monetary policy framework dearness allowance.

The Governor is the Chairperson, and the Deputy Governor and an offi ce of the RBI are appointed as ex-officio internal members of the MPC. Three other members are external, selected by the GoI in terms of criteria relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and specifi ed in the RBI Act. Each member has a single vote, with the Governor exercising a casting vote in the case of a tie. The objective is to replace individualistic decision-making by a collegial process that brings in variety of experience, expertise and independence while avoiding groupthink and free-riding. The MPC is required to meet at least once every quarter. The MPC’s decision is published immediately after its meeting, with its assessment of the prevailing macroeconomic and fi nancial conditions and the outlook, its decision and voting pattern with regard to the monetary policy action and stance. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting containing the statements of each individual member setting out his/her assessment, vote and reasons thereof are published within 14 days of the MPC’s meeting.

This Guarantee schemes for MSMEs and Kisan Credit Card stands against the demand for large fiscal stimulus that (KCC) scheme. The package also includes the monetary needs to be front-loaded in order to contain the sharp stimulus provided under liquidity measures which is to contraction in the GDP growth. However, it is important the tune of Rs. 8.01 lakh crore. The extent of support in to understand that the credit guarantee to MSMEs and comparison with the rest of the world suggests India’s KCC, though do not directly affecting the fiscal deficit, it intervention is wide-ranging and comparable to most of could add to the outstanding liabilities (broader concept the countries except Japan and US. than public debt) through contingent liabilities. In a way, Table 1 details the policy interventions that are made while this measure does not put additional fiscal cost in under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. This includes the short term, this can help in reviving investments in a range of interventions from credit guarantee, food the sectors that are hard hit not only due to pandemic and security, jobs, anti-poverty program (PMGKY), etc. the subsequent lock-down, but also due to successive There are few reform measures, not specified in the table shocks such as demonetisation and GST implementation. as they do not have any fiscal cost. However, one of the Further, this would also help banks that are struggling criticisms with regard to this package is that the fiscal cost with NPAs and provisioning can be done to businesses in of this package is just about 1.5% of GDP as most of them these crucial sectors. Against these fiscal policy measures, now there are discussions on what should be the extent of fiscal support provided to the economy in the current year. As discussed earlier, while the fiscal support under Aatmanirbhar Bharat is just about 1.5%, in our view, the fiscal support since the beginning of the current fiscal year could be larger than this and the combined (centre and states) fiscal deficit in the current financial year could be somewhere close to 12% of GDP. If one adds the public sector borrowing of about 2%, the total borrowing in the current year could be anywhere close to 14% of GDP. Here it is important to highlight that the fiscal package also needs to include the additional borrowing (of about 2.1% of GDP) that the Central Government announced even before the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package, to continue the expenditures as proposed in the Union Budget 2020- 21. While this is due to the expected decline in the revenues, additional borrowing needs to be treated as fiscal support to the ailing economy. Further, in addition to this, the states are also allowed to borrow 2% more  as suggested under the FRBM Act. Although there are some conditionalities, such relaxation should help some of the states to increase borrowings to compensate for the revenue losses as well as the increased demands for health care and other expenditures to balance lives and livelihoods. It may be added here that the government has already mentioned that it is open for more fi scal support and is yet to decide ‘when’ and ‘how much’ to spend. But it is also important to decide on where to spend. What could be the impact of these policy interventions on the GDP growth in the country? This is the most crucial question among the people. There are discussions about the shape of the recovery. Whether it would be ‘V’ or ‘U’ or ‘W’ or any other shaped recovery is something that is important for investors. While the government feels that there could be a ‘V’ shaped recovery, most analysts feel that the recovery may not be that sharp. In our view, while the slowdown was sharp due to sudden lockdown, the recovery is expected to be prolonged and that depends heavily on the implementation of fi scal-monetary packages. In a way, in our view, the recovery could look like a ‘smoking pipe’ shape with a sharp dip in the beginning and a prolonged recovery at the later stage. Indeed, there are few green shoots already visible in the economy that suggests a gradual recovery. Indicators related to credit offtake to MSMEs, rural development expenditures (which suggest utilisation of over 80% of annual allocation), electricity demand, etc., suggest pick-up in economic activities across the sectors. At the state level, while the expenditures due to pandemic has increased manifold, the revenues have dwindled largely due to decline in the revenues under GST. This has led to large gap between the actual and the promised 14% increase in the GST proceeds to every state government. While this could lead to some tensions between Centre and States, the pressure on the States to borrow more could be huge and this could lead to substantial jump in the public debt at the state level. Here, as many have suggested, it is important for the Centre to help the states by borrowing from the market directly so that the interest burden on the states could reduce. Overall, in our view, while the fi scal and monetary supports that are announced are substantial, the impacts of these measures depend heavily on how they are implemented. Going by the present trends, one could be optimistic that these measures should help the economy to revive, although the extent of revival could also depend on how the pandemic situation is going to evolve in the coming months. There is also equal concern on /2020 how these measures are going to affect the inflation management. 1503 INdusTrIAL poLICy spECIAL ArTICLE Facilitating Self-Reliance Anand Singh Bhal Supriya Malik India’s Industrial Policy has evolved over the years, and relevant changes have been introduced based on the exigencies of time.
