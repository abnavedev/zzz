Natural Gas Marketing Reforms In a significant step to move towards gas-based economy, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved ‘Natural Gas Marketing Reforms’. The objective of the policy is to prescribe standard procedure to discover market price of gas to be sold by gas producers, through a transparent and competitive process, permit Affiliates to participate in bidding process for sale of gas and allow marketing freedom to certain Field Development Plans (FDPs) where Production Sharing Contracts already provide pricing freedom. The policy aims to provide standard procedure for sale by contractor through e-bidding. This will bring uniformity in the bidding process across the various contractual regimes and policies to avoid ambiguity and contribute towards ease of doing business. The policy has also permitted Affiliate companies to participate in the bidding process in view of the open, transparent and electronic bidding. This will facilitate and promote more competition in marketing of gas. However, rebidding will have to be done in case only affiliates participate, and there are no other bidders. The policy will also grant marketing freedom to the Field Development Plans (FDPs) of those Blocks in which Production Sharing Contracts already provide pricing Freedom The Government has taken transformative reforms in the upstream sector with a view to make investment easier focusing on ease of doing business. The Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) which is investor driven acreage auction process, has increased substantial acreages in the country. No blocks were allocated between 2010 and 2017 which has impacted the long term viability of the domestic production. Since 2017, more than 1.6 lakh sq. km area under 105 exploration blocks has been allocated. This will ensure sustainability of the domestic production in long run. Government brought a series of reforms in Gas sector and as a result investment of more than Rs. 70,000 crore is being made in the East coast. Gas production from East coast will contribute to Aatmanirbhar Bharat by meeting increasing energy needs of the country. In February 2019, Government implemented major reforms in upstream sector and brought paradigm shift by focusing on production maximisation. Acreages under OALP rounds are being allocated based on work programme only in Cat II and Cat III basins. The domestic gas production has complete marketing and pricing freedom. All discoveries and fi eld development plans approved after February 28, 2019 have complete market and pricing freedom. These reforms will build on a series of transformative reforms rolled out by the Government in last several years. These reforms in gas sector will further deepen and spur the economic activities in the following areas: • The whole eco-system of policies relating to production, infrastructure and marketing of natural gas has been made more transparent with a focus on ease of doing business. • These reforms will prove very significant for Aatmanirbhar Bharat by encouraging investments in the domestic production of natural gas and reducing import dependence. • These reforms will prove to be another milestone in moving towards a gas-based economy by encouraging investments. • The increased gas production consumption will help in improvement of environment. • These reforms will also help in creating employment opportunities in the gas consuming sectors including MSMEs. • The domestic production will further help in increasing investment in the downstream industries such as City Gas Distribution and related industries. The Road Ahead When the road is rough, a fi rm control over brake and accelerator determines how smooth the ride would be. The same holds true for the unprecedented situation we are in. It began with a complete lockdown, to contain the pandemic and ensure better preparedness, and now with the series of unlocks, the economic activities are gradually gaining momentum. The tradeoff is between accelerating economy and applying brake to control the pandemic. Monetary and fi scal measures taken in this direction are important for this road to recovery. Though, infl ation, employment scenario and the ongoing health crisis will continue to cast a shadow for a while. International cues especially the progress on the vaccine front will decide by when the international travel can resume, businesses can revitalise, offices can resume with full workforce, and economy embraces the new normal way of functioning. The reforms and stimulus under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative aim to strengthen and reboot various sectors. Based on the pillars of Economy, Infrastructure, System, Demography and Demand, the reforms resolve to provide impetus to sectors and areas which have noticed sluggish movement. The Aatmanirbhar Bharat Package includes wide-ranging interventions such as direct benefit transfer, food security, rural jobs under MGNREGS, Credit Guarantee schemes for MSMEs and Kisan Credit Card Scheme. To infuse money into the economy and boost consumption, the Government has taken various measures including the LTC Cash Voucher scheme and Festival advance to the central government employees. The extent of support in comparison with the rest of the world suggests India’s intervention is wide-ranging, pragmatic and catering to the localised needs. The Principal Economic Adviser in the lead article of this Special issue has elucidated on the “Barbell” strategy used in financial markets – i.e. hedge first for the worst possible outcome while progressing step-by-step with updating of information and has compared it with the strategy devised in India to combat the impact of pandemic and the rationale behind it. The issue discusses in detail various monetary measures to consolidate the state of economy. It also brings out the possibility of changing landscape of industries and businesses with certain businesses losing relevance while bringing new opportunities to some service and tech-based sectors. Efforts to develop a multi-dimensional and multi-scalar response that acknowledges the contribution of migrants in the economy of cities have been highlighted. India is uniquely placed in terms of demographic dividends. Over 62% people in the country fall in the age group of 15-59 years which is expected to rise up to 65% by 2035. Job losses due to the pandemic are a grim reality. The current situation has certainly devastated a large section of the working population. But, there has been a growing trend towards efforts to increase employment opportunities. The recent announcement by the Government regarding creation of National Recruitment Agency is likely to be a game changer in terms of streamlining and standardising the processes. It is important to focus on advancement of skills in line with the emerging economic realities of the market. Given this, there is a need for the government and private sector to work together to address skill gaps and link supply with demand and vice-versa. Equipped with the right skills to meet the emerging demand of the new industrial era, the youth will be the torchbearers of India’s march to becoming a self-reliant nation. Agriculture has already demonstrated its potential to revive the pandemic-hit economy. To sustain agricultural growth and boost rural economy in post-Covid era, it is critical to have a robust infrastructure in place to support farm and farm processing based activities. Midst the slump, agriculture has shown a bright spot. Being an agrarian economy, agriculture is the core sector which generates employment. Spurring the rural economic growth can give new direction to the economy. This edition of Yojana seeks views and opinions of experts to assess the current economic situation, its impact on various sectors and the road that lies ahead Preparing India for an Uncertain Post-Covid World Sanjeev Sanyal sTruCTurAL rEForms The author is Principal Economic Adviser, Ministry of Finance, GoI. Email: sanjeev.sanyal@gov.in The world has just experienced the biggest shock since World War II. The immediate response is well underway. Based on a “barbell strategy”, India’s economic and health response has been somewhat different than that of other countries in terms of sequencing and emphasis of various measures. The long-term response, however, is aimed at making the Indian economy more resilient and flexible in order to deal with the opportunities and problems of the post-Covid world. he world economy experienced a major crisis in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the biggest shock to the world economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II. Not surprisingly, Indian policy-makers too faced a challenging period on both health and economic fronts. As we move past the peak of the crisis, however, it is important to record our thoughts from this time. Future historians will have the benefit of knowing the outcomes of today’s decisions but it is important to explicitly note down why certain decisions are taken while situation was still evolving and considerable uncertainty prevails. This will hopefully also help future generations when they find themselves in similar conditions of extreme uncertainty. At the same time, it is important to provide a framework for thinking coherently about an emerging but not yet clearly established post-Covid world. This essay is an attempt to do both. The Barbell Strategy It is important, firstly, to explicitly lay out the intellectual framework of India’s response to both the health and economic challenges caused by the pandemic. The central problem in both cases related to making major decisions under conditions of extreme uncertainty and paucity of information; what can be dubbed “the fog of war”. Back in March 2020, very little was known about Covid-19 beyond the fact that there had been a major outbreak in Wuhan, China, and that it was suddenly killing a lot of people in northern Italy. There were also signs that it was rapidly spreading to other countries. The World Health Organization, however, was far from clear in its recommendation and changed its stance repeatedly. Epidemic experts consulted by governments around the world provided wide-ranging assessments. Some advocated herd immunity, while others predicted millions of deaths unless something drastic was done. One epidemic expert, much quoted in the media, stated that India would have 200-300 million infected by July 2020 and as many as 2 million deaths. Given the wide range of expert opinion, different governments took different approaches and many changed course midway. Indian policy-makers, consequently, were making decisions under extreme uncertainty while being aware that it would not be possible to course correct later with 1.35 billion people. Whatever strategy was adapted was a one-way street and would have to be held to the end. It was also recognised that it was probably a marathon rather than a sprint. Given these constraints, the Central Government opted for what is known in financial markets as a “barbell” strategy – i.e. hedge first for the worst-possible outcome while progressing step-by-step with a Bayesian updating of information. The initial total lockdown, therefore, should be seen as a hedge against the worst possible outcomes. It was bolstered by advice from some experts who argued that a strong initial lockdown could stall the epidemic at an early stage (this was not an unreasonable idea given the available information). It should be noted that this initial lockdown also gave the space to arrange a large-scale medical response in terms of equipment, quarantine and testing capacity. As time has passed, the central government then unlocked the economy step-by-step as information as well as medical capacity both improved. Lockdowns and other responses were increasingly left to local governments. Meanwhile, better information meant that it was possible to make sensible tradeoffs between health and economic needs. This explains why the government was later willing to keep opening up despite there being many Covid-19 infected people whereas it had done an initial lockdown when there were very few patients. The same barbell strategy was used in the economic response. The Indian economic response during the lockdown phase was oriented more towards providing a cushion to the most vulnerable segments of society and of the business sector (such as medium and small enterprises). This explains the emphasis on food availability, cash transfers to Jan Dhan accounts, government guarantees on loans to small enterprises, moratoria and postponement of financial deadlines. Every effort was made to avert a cascade of defaults in the banking system. The emphasis was on providing a safety net (i.e. hedging against worst-case outcomes) and was not an attempt to refl ate demand. Unlike many other countries that front-loaded large stimulus packages, Indian policy-makers decided that trying to pump demand during a lockdown was like pressing the accelerator when the foot was firmly on the brake. It was better to save the ammunition for later as the cycle of demand simply would not take-off in a lockdown. Instead, the time was used to put in place long-term structural reforms in anticipation of the post-Covid world. With the economy mostly unlocked by early October, there is now a case for an appropriate demand stimulus with infrastructure investment taking center-stage. Both monetary and fi scal space exists for this push despite the widening of the fiscal deficit. Demand-driven inflation is not a major issue as almost all price increases are due to supply disruptions. With the Rupee under pressure to appreciate and a current account surplus feeding foreign exchange reserves (standing at US$545bn in end September), there is space for allowing the transmission of an expansionary monetary impulse to reignite India’s fi nancial system. Meanwhile, as mentioned by both the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, an infrastructure pipeline is being ramped up. But can a push on large-scale infrastructure investment be financed? Every fi nancing avenue will be explored including foreign and domestic capital, asset monetisation The Central Government opted for what is known in financial markets as a “barbell” strategy – i.e. hedge first for the worst possible outcome while progressing step-by-step with a Bayesian updating of information. The initial total lockdown, therefore, should be seen as a hedge against the worst possible outcomes. and even deficit monetisation. Indian media and academics tend to be excessively critical of monetisation. This is dogma. Carefully calibrated monetisation should be part of the financing mix. Adapting to a Post-Covid World The Covid-19 pandemic is the biggest global disruption in generations. The post-Covid world that emerges from this crisis will not be a mildly-altered version of pre-Covid world. This new world will have its own geo-politics, supply chains, technological innovations, institutional structures, consumer preferences and so on. All of these factors will interact in multiple, unpredictable ways. Therefore, it is very difficult to make grand predictions about how exactly the post-Covid world will function. After all, it would have been difficult to predict in 1940 that British and French colonial empires would collapse within a decade, that global geo-politics would be dominated for half a century by a US–USSR Cold War, that man would set foot on the moon, and that televisions would become everyday items. So, how can one prepare for an uncertain new world? Rather than invest in a rigidly master-planned response, it is better to invest in two things: flexibility and resilience. This is the context in which recent supply-side reforms need to be seen. Even a cursory look at recently announced structural reforms would show that they have one thing in commonan attempt to encourage flexibility and adaptation in India’s economy. The agriculture sector reforms free-up farmers to sell their produce as they wish while those involved in the supply chain can invest in storage without fear of being labeled “hoarders”. This will allow the farm sector and farm-related industries to adapt their activities to changes in demographics, climate change, consumer tastes and so on. India has the world’s second largest stock of cultivable land and there is no reason it shouldn’t be an export powerhouse in agriculture. Similarly, dozens of central labour laws have been reduced to four internally consistent codes. On one hand they strengthen laws related to safety and working conditions, on the other hand they allow employers greater flexibility. Again, this is important for an unpredictable, evolving post-Covid world where the economy needs to be able to efficiently redeploy the workforce according to changing conditions. Other recently announced reforms related to bilateral netting, and trade fi nance factoring are also directly aimed at improving the flexibility of the fi nancial system. The other ingredient of the longer term post- Covid framework is the emphasis on resilience. This is the key to understand the Prime Minister’s vision of “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” or Self-reliant India. This phrase is often misinterpreted as a return to the inward-looking, import substitution of the socialist era. This is explicitly not the case as the Prime Minister himself has clarifi ed that his vision includes increased participation in global supply chains as well as a greater encouragement of foreign direct investment. This is not about an inward-looking retreat into a shell. The main idea of self-reliance is that India should become more resilient by leveraging its internal strengths. It should also be unapologetic about pursuing its national interests. For example, the Indian government decided to opt out of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (better known by the acronym RCEP) as it felt that the trade arrangement did not serve national interest. This is not an ideological opposition to trade pacts since other trade deals will continue to be pursued where India has more to gain. Similarly, India’s globally competitive pharmaceuticals industry was found to be too dependent on critical imported inputs with supply lines that can be easily disrupted (as happened during the recent pandemic). Hence, an effort is being made to bring some of the input production back to India. Again, note that this is not about protecting an inefficient industry but about the resilience of a globally competitive one. Looking ahead, a resilient and flexible response to the unpredictable problems and opportunities of the post-Covid world will require reforms in two further areas–administrative structure and the legal system. In both cases, an archaic rigid system is unable to deal with the needs of the twenty-fi rst century. Some progress is now being made on administrative reforms. A big effort is being made on digitisation of records, the use of online applications and the rationalisation of defunct government bodies. A similar effort, in partnership with the judiciary, needs to be made for upgrading a legal process with 36 million pending cases. In a complex and evolving world, the sanctity of a contract is often the only anchor of certainty. Perhaps we need a public debate on how the inability of the legal process to enforce even routine contracts may now be the single biggest constrain on economic development. Such a debate may help build a nonpartisan national consensus on how to proceed on this critical area of reform. Conclusion The world has just experienced the biggest shock since World War II. The immediate response is well underway. Based on a “barbell strategy”, India’s economic and health response has been somewhat different than that of other countries in terms of sequencing and emphasis of various measures. The cycle has not yet fully played out but, as the economy gets fully unlocked, the emphasis will shift towards stimulating demand using infrastructure investment. The longterm response, however, is aimed at making the Indian economy more resilient and flexible in order to deal with the opportunities and problems of the post-Covid world. Recent reforms in agriculture, labour markets and the financial system should be seen in this light. This is also the context for Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Of course, many other areas also need change but arguably the administrative and legal systems should now be the focus of next generation of reforms.  The agriculture sector reforms free up farmers to sell their produce as they wish while those involved in the supply chain can invest in storage without fear of being labeled “hoarders”. This will allow the farm sector and farm-related industries to adapt their activities to changes in demographics, climate change, consumer tastes and so on. India has the world’s second largest stock of cultivable land and there is no reason it shouldn’t be an export powerhouse in agriculture.
