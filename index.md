Absolute Monarchies
General Survey
The dawn of modern period in Europe also witnessed the emergence of the new absolute monarchs who were building cohesive political structures. The roots of this consolidation process go back to the death of Charlemagne in 814, when Europe entered a period of disintegration and political anarchy. In broad terms, the political evolution of Western Europe after Charlemagne may be divided into three stages. Between 9th and 11th centuries, Popes and emperors generally cooperated. Popes helped the emperors against the German secular lords and in return were supported against the Byzantine opponents to papal authority. In 1073, with the accession of Pope Gregory VII, began the second stage–the period of papal supremacy. The investiture dispute between the papacy and the emperors (i.e., the struggle to control the selection of German bishops) was won by Gregory. So, imperial administration and power were undermined. For over two centuries, the papacy was generally recognised as the head of Latin Christendom, particularly because there was a succession of pious French and English kings in the mid-13th century. The period of papal supremacy ended in 1296 on the issue of taxation of clergy. In that year, the Pope issued a bull asserting that the laity had no authority over the clergy and threatening to excommunicate anyone who attempted to tax the clergy. Philip rejected Pope’s claims and was able to enforce his policies with complete success. He even forced the transfer of the papal seat from Rome to Avignon, and from then on the papacy collaborated openly with the French monarchy.
By the end of the 15th century, this trend away from the universal Church and towards the new absolute monarchies was apparent in the powerful political structures presided over by several rulers in Europe. One reason for the success of these rulers was the revolution in military technology that came with the advent of artillery. Feudal lords no longer could defy royal authority from behind their castle walls. Only absolute monarchs possessed the financial resources and administrative organisation necessary to purchase the guns, powder, and the shot and to provide required logistical support.
Another source of power for the new monarchs was their informal alliance with the growing merchant class. From this class, the kings obtained essential financial support and also competent and subservient officials to staff the growing state bureaucracies. In return, the consolidation of royal power aided the burghers by ending the incessant feudal wars and doing away with the crazy pattern of local feudal authorities in which each had its own customs, laws, weights, and currencies.
The new monarchs naturally had their own defenders and rationalisers, as do all political establishments. The best known of these was Niccola Machiavelli (1459–1527), a product of the ruthless struggle for survival amongst the competing city-states of Renaissance Italy. Machiavelli viewed politics as a struggle for power in which the end justifies the means. In his book, The Prince, he set forth guidelines for the rulers who aspired to unite the fragmented Italian peninsula and to get it rid of the French and Spanish invaders. With cool and relentless realism, he rejected moral restraints and spelled out the difference between politics and religion or philosophy.
The new monarchs pursuing strategies based on the precepts of The Prince were bound to clash with the two universal institutions of Europe, the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. The conflict was sharpened by the sensational rise of the Spanish dynasty through marriage ties. Ferdinand and Isabella married their daughter Joanna to Philip of Hapsburg. Charles, the offspring of this union, inherited the united Spanish kingdom together with the Spanish possessions in the New World and in Italy (Sardinia, Sicily and Naples). He also held the hereditary Hapsburg lands in Europe in spite of the opposition of French and English monarchs. Thus Charles V, at the age of 19, became the ruler of a larger territory than had been collected under one monarch since the break-up of Charlemagne’s empire seven centuries earlier.
For a time it appeared that Western Europe would be united once more in a vast international organisation. Other European dynasties, and especially the Valois of France, were determined to prevent Hapsburg hegemony. The result was the long series of wars, partly religious, and partly dynastic. This prolonged violence was followed by the even more disastrous Thirty Years War. Although this war was precipitated by the question of the succession to the Bohemian throne, it soon became essentially a struggle between the Bourbon and Hapsburg dynasties for control of the continent of Europe.
The territorial provisions of the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) did not last, but their overall significance is clear. The princes of Central Europe, backed by France, Sweden and other countries successfully resisted the centralising efforts of the Hapsburgs. The empire now was a collection of small independent states, each with the right to conduct its foreign as well as domestic affairs.
Thus, the decline of the Empire and of the papacy, and the growth of separate nations inevitably led to the formation of strong monarchies in many of the countries of Europe. Kings aimed at making themselves absolute, and they were frequently successful. At the end of the 16th century, France was rapidly approaching a position in which the king could do practically as he liked; Spain was ruled autocratically, so were many Italian principalities; and the English monarchy had reached the zenith of its power. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the rulers of France, Russia, Austria and Prussia succeeded in enhancing considerably the strength and the outward grandeur of their positions, but in England attempts to establish absolute monarchy ended in failure. There the trading and commercial classes were prepared to tolerate royal pretensions, so long as they did not seriously interfere with their own interests, but when the dignity of royalty demanded arbitrary taxation and the control of people’s consciences, they preferred rebellion to compliance with a state of affairs which struck at the very root of personal liberty. The middle classes of the continental countries also did the same ultimately, but at a much later date.
What were the New Absolute Monarchies? European history from the beginning of the 16th century onward is a story of people finding their way darkly to some new method of government better suited to the newly arising conditions. The search for a new method of government first took the form of new absolute monarchies. An important sign of the growing authority of kings in the 16th and 17th centuries was the universal decay of the representative institutions which had come into existence in many European countries in the later Middle Ages. By 1789, most of Europe was ruled by monarchs little hindered by the existence of effective and continuing representative bodies, the main exception being Great Britain. Kings began their ascent to this position in the 16th century, when they came to enjoy almost absolute powers. This phenomenon is generally termed as the rise of absolute monarchy.
In many countries, the late 15th century had brought a widespread wish to do away with disorder. People were ready to accept government if it would guarantee order and peace. There were special reasons in almost every case, but nearly everywhere monarchs raised themselves further above the level of the greatest nobles and buttressed their new pretensions to respect authority with cannons and taxation. The obligatory sharing of power with their great subjects, whose status entitled them de facto and sometimes de jure to office, ceased to weigh so heavily upon kings who more and more could choose their own servants.
Why did they Come into Being? From 16th century onward, the history of Europe is a story of political and social institutions becoming more and more plainly misfits, less comfortable and more vexatious, and of the slow, reluctant realisation of the need for a conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole scheme of human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new to all the former experiences of life. What are these changes in the conditions of human life that have disorganised the balance of empire, priest, peasant and trader that has held human affairs in the old world in a sort of working rhythm for such a long time? They were manifold and various, for human affairs are multitudinously complex.
The feudal lords during the Middle Ages created political anarchy all over the continent, by their bloody and continuous warfare. The people were exasperated over this sorry state of affairs, and wanted the establishment of a strong centralised government capable of maintaining peace and order and providing security of life and property. Thus, popular support was given to the monarchs in their contest against the feudal lords and the Church, because these kings promised a more capable form of government.
Geographical discoveries promoted commercial activities which in turn paved the way for the rise of the bourgeoisie. These middle classes, especially merchants, traders and industrialists provided full support to the absolute monarchs to establish stable governments which could restore peace and order, and enable them to carry on their trade peacefully. They provided rulers with human and material help to crush the feudal lords.
In the Middle Ages, kings had no standing armies, and each feudal lord maintained his own armed forces, rendering military service to the king whenever the need arose. This military dependence of the kings on the feudal lords made his position weak viś-a-vis the lords. But the economic transformation of Europe at the time enabled the kings to maintain standing armies. The introduction of guns and gunpowder into Europe brought about a great change in the methods of warfare. The kings claimed the monopoly of gunpowder, and began to equip their forces with firearms. With their help, kings destroyed the castles of the feudal lords, and thus gave a death blow to their military strength.
The decline of feudalism, the growing urbanisation and the revival of trade and commerce sowed the seeds of nationalism, while the wars of the late Middle Ages and the religious wars in the wake of the Reformation also aroused the feeling of nationalism among the Europeans. In the face of danger from a common enemy, people of a particular country forget their differences and begin to think of themselves as a nation. These wars against a common enemy enhanced the power and prestige of the monarchs who led the people in these wars, and thus made it possible for them to establish their absolute rule.
The Renaissance scholars and the leaders of the Reformation were generally in favour of absolute governments. The revival of classics enabled the people to realise that they would do better under a strong centralised government. The Reformation also rejected the idea of Universal Church and empire, and thus strengthened absolutism of national kings. Martin Luther, for example, emphasised the doctrine of divine right of kings, and advised people to give passive obedience to their rulers. The national Churches that were established after the Reformation were under the complete control of the state, and consequently the kings became more powerful and absolute.
The writings of some political philosophers and thinkers also played a crucial role in this political process. Machiavelli, for instance, favoured absolute monarchy in The Prince. A Frenchman, called Bodin (1529–1596), also stood for a strong state government in his book The State. The sovereign, he opined, should be the source of all law, and is responsible only to God. Hobbes (1588–1679), an English-man, too supported absolutism. But his concept of absolutism is different from that of Machiavelli in one important respect, i.e., the former is based on the consent of the people or governed while the latter is not.

Hobbes
Some of the contemporary rulers, such as Louis XIV of France, Frederick II of Prussia, Peter the Great and Catherine II of Russia, Joseph II of Austria, and Charles III of Spain were capable and popular which gave a boost to the institution of absolute monarchy. They were benevolent despots and well acquainted with the philosophy of Enlightenment. They implemented various reforms, and improved the economic conditions of the people. Apart from promoting agriculture, trade and industry, they also patronised education, art and literature.
How and where did they Arise? The history of nearly all Europe during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries was, as mentioned earlier, the story of an attempt to strengthen monarchy, to make it absolute, and to extend its power over weaker adjacent regions and of steady resistance, first of the feudal lords and then, with the increase of foreign trade and home industry, of the growing trading and moneyed classes to the exactions and interference of the crown.
Spain was the first to achieve importance under an absolute government. Spanish nationalism benefitted from the long drawn struggle with the Muslims, and from the newly acquired colonial possessions in Americas. The early Hapsburg rulers entered into matrimonial alliances with the most powerful families of Europe. Joanna, the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, was married to the heir of the Austrian throne; and Charles V, the offspring of this union, fell heir to the vast domains of both Spain and Austria. Besides, he was made the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. But Philip II got entangled in detrimental war with England, during which his famous Armada was destroyed (1588) and the rapid decline of Spain began. In spite of the vast colonial resources, the treasury was emptied, because the Spanish monarchs not only involved themselves in almost ceaseless warfare with foreign powers but also faced numerous rebellions at home. Moreover, the rulers antagonised the commercial and industrial class, which not only weakened the monarchy but also hampered economic progress within the country. Thus, the Spanish monarchs diminished the power of the very class that could have been theirs naturally.
In France, the new absolute monarchy was the most successful. The French kings not only reached a position of almost unbridled power and grandeur, but furnished an example which inspired the kings of other European countries. Although the landowning and the merchant classes frequently found their interests threatened by the pretensions of royalty, they were not able to resist them so effectively as the landowners and merchants of England. The French Estates General had nothing approaching the influence of the English parliament. Its meetings were irregular; kings had occasionally summoned it when they needed money, but merely in order that its approbation of new taxes might make their collection easier. They never admitted that they had not the right, if they chose to exercise it, to levy taxes without consulting their subjects at all. When the Estates-General met in 1789, the first year of the great revolution, it was actually assembling for the first time since 1614. Thus opposition to royal demands could not be effectively made in the Estates-General. Those who thought that the power of the king should be curbed had to fall back upon the device of forming leagues against him, which generally lacked unity and constructive purpose.
The most famous of these leagues was the Fronde, which was contemporary with the later stages of the English Civil War, to which it bears some resemblances. They were protests against absolute monarchy, and just as Charles I had to pay the reckoning for the deeds of his father James I, so Cardinal Mazarin, who ruled France (Louis XIV, the king, was a minor) when the Wars of the Fronde were waged, had to pay for carrying on the policy of his great master and predecessor, Cardinal Richelieu—the policy of building up a strong and ruthless absolutism, which would make the king (or his chief minister) the undisputed master of France. But the English Rebellion was successful: the Fronde was not, and one of the chief causes of its failure was the lack of seriousness among many of those who took part in it, and the selfish ambitions of others. The Frondeurs, unlike the parliamentarians of England, did not have religion to animate them and encourage them to overthrow the edifice of irresponsible government. In 1652, they were conclusively beaten, and after that date the king and his courtiers dominated French life. From this time until the Revolution of 1789, the government of France was as autocratic as it could be. Taxes were imposed in the most arbitrary manner, and in such a way that they fell principally upon the poorer classes, who were least able to pay them; wars were made in order to gratify personal ambitions and increase the grandeur of royalty; and the king definitely took up the attitude that he held his authority directly from God, and that he was answerable to no one.
Absolute monarchy reached its climax under Louis XIV, ‘The Sun King’ (1643–1715). Louis was an exceptionally ambitious man. He wished to extend the boundaries of France to the Rhine and the Pyrenees, and to absorb the Spanish Netherlands. In the former of these objects, he partially succeeded: in the latter he was thwarted by the opposition of England and Holland. It was not only by wars of aggression that Louis XIV spent the hard-earned money of the French people. Splendour was almost a craze with him: his court became proverbial for its lavish display of wealth, and his palace at Versailles, became the envy and admiration of the world. His patronage of art and literary men was part of the same policy, but a more excellent part. Louis XIV was succeeded by his great-grandson, Louis XV, during whose reign, money was spent lavishly on wars and worthless mistresses who ministered to the king’s pleasures, and France was plunged deeper and deeper into the morass of bankruptcy.
Outside France, absolute monarchy was most successful in Prussia and Russia. Prussia was ruled by the Hohenzollern dynasty, which was not overthrown until 1918. Its rise, from the comparatively small duchy of Brandenburg to a kingdom which eventually covered nearly two thirds of Germany, is one of the most striking features of modern history. The first of its rulers to give indication that formidable power was arising was the Elector Frederick William, known as the Great Elector (1640–1688), who succeeded in creating an absolute monarchy.
His son, Frederick I was the first to take the title of King of Prussia. His grandson King Frederick William I, a rough and boorish king, increased his army from 27,000 to 84,000 men, and by careful management and miserly economy left a well-filled treasury as well for his son and successor, Frederick II, who is generally called Frederick, the Great. Under him the Prussian kingdom made marvellous progress, despite two long and exhausting wars. It was considerably enlarged by the acquisition of Austrian Silesia and part of Poland; its population was trebled; its army, 200,000 strong, was the most efficient in the world; and Frederick could have declared, with perfect truth, that the state was himself. In some respects, he aped Louis XIV. He built a great palace at Potsdam which copied the glories of Versailles. He patronised literary men, and entertained Voltaire, an experiment which was not a success.
Russia, until accession of Peter the Great in 1689, was an Asiatic state with no seaport, no ships, and an army which it would have been almost ludicrous to compare with the well-disciplined troops of Western Europe. Peter spared no effort to make his country into a European power. He visited Germany, Holland, and England so as to investigate the arts and sciences of the West; he brought back with him skilled artisans, architects, ships’ captains, and scientific men to aid in the development of Russia; he forced his subjects to abandon their oriental habits, such as their custom of growing long beards: he remodelled the government according to western ideas: he built a navy and made the army more efficient; and he conquered from Sweden lands such as Litvania and Estonia, which lay between Russia and the Baltic Sea. Not content with the old capital, Moscow, which clung somewhat tenaciously to its ancient habit, he built a new capital, St. Petersburg, and like Frederick the Great of Prussia, he built in imitation of Versailles, the Peterhof. Almost the only feature of the old regime which he was content to retain was its despotic nature. The Czar must remain the absolute master of all his subjects, and there are frequent instances of Peter punishing those who dared to resist his authority with barbarity. After Peter’s death in 1725, Russia was governed by various incompetent rulers until the accession of Catherine II, a German princess, in 1762. She ascended the throne after arranging the murder of her husband the Czar, and ever since her time, Russia has been a force to be reckoned with in the affairs of Europe and the world.
Another family, the Hapsburgs, from their capital of Vienna had been gradually building up the Austrian Empire, the vast realm over which they ruled until 1918. From 1438 until 1806, although the old form of election was still maintained, all but one of the Emperors were Hapsburgs, and in 1806, when Napoleon brought the Holy Roman Empire to an end, they took the less pretentious but far more practical title of Emperor of Austria. When Maria Theresa succeeded her father in 1740, the Austrian dominions included Austria, Moravia, Hungary, Bohemia, Silesia, Styra, Carinthia, Tyrol, and the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium), and Milan. Silesia was soon conquered by Frederick of Prussia, but the Empress secured some compensation by the acquisition of Galician Poland. The task of ruling these extensive territories was a particularly difficult one, because of the numerous and diverse races who inhabited them. When Maria Theresa died after a reign of 40 years she was succeeded by her son Joseph II, a man of considerable enlightenment, whose great ambition was to consolidate all his dominions into one homogeneous whole, to break down the barriers of nationality, to raise the community to legal equality with their former masters, to constitute a uniform level of democratic simplicity under his own absolute sway. His intentions were, generally speaking, admirable, and if he had to deal with an enlightened or united people, they would have been welcomed. But Joseph, when he set himself the task of forming a well-organised central state, like that formed by Frederick the Great in Prussia, apparently failed to grasp the peculiar difficulties of his position. He had to carry through his policy in a state composed of the most diverse elements in Europe, only held together by the personal tie of sovereignty and the influence of the Church, which he alienated by an attack upon its privileges. National prejudices were too strong for him; he was regarded with suspicion on all hands; insurrections broke out in the Netherlands and other places, and, despite his utmost efforts, Austria remained a ramshackle empire until its final dissolution in 1918.
In England, Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I of the Tudor dynasty, with the help of their ministers Wolsey and Burleigh respectively, laid the foundations for absolutism, but it was destroyed by the folly of the first Stuarts, James I and Charles I. The latter was beheaded for treason to his people in 1649, marking an aberration in the political thought of Europe. For a dozen years, i.e., until 1660, Britain was a republic; and the Crown was an unsteady power, overwhelmed by Parliament, until George III (1760–1820) made a relentless but only a partly successful effort to restore its predominance.
 
Europe in 1519
Why did they Decline? The main defect of the absolute monarchy with its hereditary nature lay in the over dependency upon the character and personality of the monarch. Where there was a good ruler there was a good government, but a succession of good rulers could not be assured. A good number of them neglected their duties and enjoyed the splendour and luxury of the court instead of taking care of the details of government. Routine work was delegated to ruthless ministers, who fully exploited the situation to their advantage.
The absolute monarchs, without exception, carried on schemes of aggrandisement against each other. Each one pursued a “foreign policy” of aggression against his neighbours and of aggressive alliances. We are also told of how this war was caused by the king’s mistress, and how the jealousy of one minister for another caused that. Thus, aggrandisement and whimsical policies caused destructive wars, which in turn often resulted in economic ruin.
In spite of the triumph of absolutism, the idea of popular government still had an appeal. Some of the states, in fact, had representative bodies. France had ‘Estates General’, which, however, soon ceased to exert any influence, but the English Parliament got itself entrenched in the 17th century. Cities in Northern Italy, in France, and in the Swiss Cantons had representative governments. The existence of the idea of popular government and of the representative bodies began to influence the minds of those people who were ruled by absolute monarchs particularly when these monarchs were inefficient and degenerate.
Finally, the principle of absolutism itself did not go uncontested, and in fact, it was assailed severely in some places. In the 16th century itself, the Netherlands rebelled against the rule of the Spanish Crown and a century later, its people (the Dutch) established a republic, with political power vested in parliament. Poland repudiated absolutism, but fell victim to the territorial ambitions of Prussia, Russia and Austria. Thus, absolutism had been challenged and gradually gained disrepute among the democratic minded people.
The Nation-States
General Survey
Most people in the world today are familiar, at least in a rough and ready way, with the idea of the state. They accept that the world’s surface is divided by impersonal organisations working through officials marked out in special ways, and that such organisations provide the final public authority for any given area. Often, they might also think that the state in some way represented a nation. But whether they did so or not, states would be the building blocks from which most of us would construct a political account of the modern world.
Hardly any of this would have been intelligible to an European in 1000 AD. The process, by which the modern state emerged, though far from complete by 1500, is one of the markers which delimit the modern era of history. The realities had come first before principles and ideas. From the 13th century onwards, many rulers, usually kings, were able, for a variety of reasons, to increase their power over those they ruled. This was often because they could keep up large armies and arm them with the most effective weapons. Many rulers were by 1500 well on the way to exercising a monopoly of the use of armed force within their realms. These realms, too, had increasingly well-defined frontiers and thus expressed more than just an improvement in surveying. It marked a change in emphasis within government from a claim to control persons who had a particular relationship to the ruler to one to control people who lived in a certain area. Territorial dependence was, thus, replacing personal dependence.
Over such territorial agglomerations, royal power was by 1500 coming to be exercised directly through officials. Like cannon, they had to be paid, for a kingship which worked through vassals known to the king who did much of his work for him in return for his favours, and who supported him in the field when his needs went beyond what his own estates could supply, gave way to one in which royal government was carried out by its own employees, paid for by the taxation (more and more in cash, not kind), the raising of which was one of their most important tasks. The parchment of charters and rolls began by the 16th century to give way to the first trickles and rivulets of what was to become the flood of modern bureaucratic paper.
Europe was beginning by 1500 to organise itself in a way unlike the Europe of Carolingians and Ottonians. Though personal and local ties remained overwhelmingly the most important ones for most Europeans–and were to be for centuries–society was institutionalised in a different way from the 11th century when even tribal survivals still counted. The relationship of lord and vassal which, with the vague claims of Pope and emperor in the background, so long seemed to exhaust political thought, gave way to an idea of princely power over all the inhabitants of a domain.
Necessarily, the change to such a state of affairs neither took place everywhere in the same way nor at the same pace. By 1800, France and England had been for centuries unified in a way that Germany and Italy were still not. But wherever it happened, the centre of the process was usually the steady aggrandisement of royal families. Kings had great advantages in different fields of administration and additionally could make use of several new forces that were emerging.
One such force was the sense of nationhood. This is another idea which modern man takes for granted, but we must be careful not to antedate the moment at which men began to think of themselves as Englishmen and Frenchmen. No medieval state was national in our sense. Nevertheless, by 1500, the subjects of the kings of England and France could often think of themselves as different from aliens who were not their fellow-subjects, even if they might also regard people who lived in the next village as virtually foreigners.
We must not exaggerate the immediate impact of such developments. For centuries yet, family, local community, religion or trade were still to be the only focus of most men’s loyalties. Such national institutions as they could have seen growing among them would have done little to break into this conservatism. The rural parishes and little towns of the Middle Ages, on the other hand, were communities, and in ordinary times they exhausted any man’s need to go further in thinking about social responsibilities. We really need another word than ‘nationalism’ to suggest the realm which might once in a while touch a medieval man, or even the irritation which might suddenly burst out in a riot against the presence of foreigners, whether workmen or merchants. Yet, such hints of national feeling occasionally reveal the slow consolidation of support for new states in Western Europe.
The first of them to cover anything like the areas of their modern successors were England and France. The Normans, a few thousands of whom came over from France to establish themselves after the invasion of 1066 as a new ruling class, were England’s last successful invaders. Their leader, William the Conqueror, gave them lands, but retained more for himself and asserted an ultimate lordship over the rest. For a long time, though, the Anglo-Norman Kings thought of themselves as something more than kings of an island state. They were heirs of a complex inheritance of possessions and feudal dependencies which at its furthest stretched far into South-Western France, and like their followers spoke Norman-French. The loss of most of this ‘Angevin’ inheritance at the beginning of the 12th century was decisive for France as well as for England. A sense of nationhood was nurtured in each of them by their quarrels with one another.
The Capetians had hung on grimly and with increasing success to the French Crown. From the 10th to the 14th century, their kings succeeded one another in unbroken hereditary succession. The Capetians’ lands fell in the heartland of modern France, the cereal-growing area around Paris, which was for a long time the only part of the country bearing the old name of France, thus commemorating the fact that it was a fragment of the old kingdom of the French. The domains of the first Capetians were so distinguished from the other west Carolingian territories, such as Burgundy; that by 1300, their successors had expanded ‘Francia’ to include other areas. By then the French kings had also acquired Normandy and other feudal dependencies from the English kings.
This is a reminder that in the 14th century (and later), there were still great fiefs and feudal principalities of the Capetian kingdom as a monolithic unity. Yet it was a unity of sorts, though much rested on the personal tie. During the 14th century, that unity was greatly enhanced by a long struggle with England remembered by the misleading name of the Hundred Years’ War. In fact, the English and French were only sporadically at war from 1337 to 1453, fighting being far from continuous. Yet it was always easy to make it flare up again in a new campaign because the opportunities it offered to English noblemen for booty and ransom money made war seem a plausible investment to many of them. On the other hand, sustained warfare was difficult to keep up; it was too expensive. Formally, what was at stake was the maintenance by the kings of England of territorial and feudal claims on the French side of the Channel.
For England, the long-run looser, the most important immediate results of these quarrels were new additions to the infant mythology of nationhood and the creation of a long-living distrust of the French. Dislike was heartily reciprocated: after all, the campaigning took place in France. The Hundred Years’ War was also indirectly important to the French monarchy because it did something to check feudal fragmentation and moved French men about, breaking down the barriers. In France, too, the national mythology benefitted; its greatest acquisition was the story and example of Joan of Arc whose astonishing career accompanied the turning of the long struggle against the English. After 1453, French kings could push forward with the consolidation of their state undisturbed by the obscure claims of England’s rulers from which the wars had sprung. They could settle down to establish their sovereignty over their rebellious magnates at their leisure. In each country, war in the long run strengthened the state.
Such a clear outcome to the process of national consolidation was to be seen in only one other Western kingdom, Spain, whose rise had been made easier by the Reconquest, the long struggle against Islam, which from the start gave Spanish nationhood a quite special flavour because of its intimate connection with Christian faith and fervour. Portugal in the peninsula remained outside the New Spain, clinging to an independence often threatened by her powerful neighbour.
Thus, by 1500 much of the political ground-plan of modern Europe was in being. England, France, Spain and Portugal were recognisable in their modern form, though in Italy and Germany, where vernacular language defined nationhood, there was no correspondence between the nation and the state.
Why did they Emerge? The decline of feudalism curtailed the powers of the feudal lords and enabled capable rulers to assert their authority. Kings had great advantages viś-a-vis the feudal lords. If they managed their affairs carefully, they would have had a more solid base for their power than their nobles in their own domains. Their office had a mysterious aura about it which reflected in various royal ceremonies. Their judicial machinery seemed to promise a more independent, less expensive justice than could be got from the local feudal lords. They could, therefore, appeal not only to the resources of the feudal structure at whose head they stood, but also to forces outside that structure such as the sense of nationhood (which was slowly but steadily gaining ground in Europe), the spirit of Renaissance and Reformation, etc.
The spirit of nationalism or the sense of nationhood was slowly revealing itself as of growing importance by the end of the Middle Ages. By 1500, the subjects of the kings of England and France could often think of themselves as different from foreigners who were not their follow-subjects. Even 200 years earlier, this sort of difference between those born within and those born outside the realm was being made. An important sign of this enhanced sense of community of the native born was the appearance of belief in national patronsaints such as St. George for England. Another example was the writings of national histories and the discovery of national heroes such as Arthur for Welsh and Brain Boru for Irish. Moreover, there was the development of vernacular languages into national literary languages. Spanish, Italian, French and English one after another began to break through the barrier set by Latin about literary creativity. The ancestors of these tongues are recognisable in the 12th century romances such as the song of Roland (which transformed a defeat of Charlemagne by Pyrenean mountaineers into a glorious stand of his rear guard against the Arabs), or the poem of Cid (the Spanish national hero). With the 14th century came Dante, Langland and Chaucer, each of them writing in a language modern man could read with ease. Then came the renaissance writers, poets and dramatists who completely raised the vernacular languages to a position of national literary languages.
The decline of feudalism, the urbanisation and the commercial revolution were supplementary factors in the growth of the spirit of nationalism, while war accentuated national centralisation. Patriotism, for instance, goaded people to support the governments of France and England in the long-drawnout struggle of the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453). Henry V of England succeeded in gaining popular approval for his claim to the French throne, and Joan of Arc infused in the French people an impassioned support for the defense of their country. Spanish nationalism was achieved in the struggle with the Moors and was taken to fruition in the conquest of the New World.
The emergence of the urban middle class, along with increased trade and commerce, was another crucial factor in the emergence of the nation-states. The city people, in their own interests, favoured strong and absolute rulers. Commercial rivalries led the merchants to look for support of their respective rulers and this served to foster and promote a feeling of nationality which in turn facilitated the rise of nation-states.
Where and when did they Emerge? France appeared to be a separate kingdom as early as the 9th century, but in the 13th century also, Philip Augustus was trying to assert his power against the feudal lords. Even in the 14th century, there were still feudal principalities in what is now France which is quite jarring. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the unity was greatly strengthened by a protracted struggle with England in the form of the so-called Hundred Years’ War. For France, the long-run winner, this war had two advantages. First, it strengthened the French monarchy because it prevented feudal fragmentation in the face of threat from the foreigners and thus helped the French kings to consolidate their authority. Secondly, it helped the infant nationhood. Joan of Arc roused the patriotic sentiments of the French and led the French army in liberating the Northern half of France from England. Thus, by the close of the war, French monarch was a national ruler and France was on the threshold of becoming a modern state.
In England, William the Conqueror, founded a strong monarchy in the 11th century. Though in the following 200 years, the feudal lords enhanced their power, during the 14th century, they began to lose out to the king. For the growth of trade and commerce, of cities and the rise of the middle classes together increased the financial and military powers of the king. Then the Hundred Years’ War resulted in new additions to the English national mythology, though England came out as the long-run loser in this war. The “War of the Roses” (1455–85) fought between two groups of feudal Lords for control over the monarchy finally brought down feudalism in England by weakening the lords and by creating a feeling of despair among the people with feudal anarchy. Henry VII, the first king of the Tudor dynasty, established a strong monarchy with the help of the middle classes. The English monarchy grew in strength under the other Tudor rulers in the 16th century, and the people of England began to think of themselves more clearly as a nation.
Such a clear process was evident in only one other Western kingdom, viz., Spain. She, too, achieved an important measure of unity by the end of the 15th century. It was first facilitated by the reconquest which was a Christian crusade against Islam bringing together men of different origins. In 1340, when the final Arab offensive was reversed, success brought in its wake the threat of political anarchy in the form of rebellions by nobles. But the monarchy, in alliance with the urban middle classes, succeeded in establishing its rule. Prior to this final triumph of monarchy, however, there was the union of the crown of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1479. The final expulsion of the Moors and the eventual creation of one nation soon followed, though the two kingdoms of Aragon and Castile continued their separate existence for some more time while pursuing common policies.
Portugal and Holland were also on their way to becoming nation-states. But it was not the same in the case of Italy and Germany. Neither was to be a ‘nation-state’ until the second half of the 19th century, though feudalism had ceased in both of them by 15th century. In Italy, a strong middle class had arisen as a result of trade with East, but the interference of the Pope and other powers (Austria, France, etc.,) in her affairs prevented her from becoming a single nation-state.
In Germany, on the other hand, the dukes were powerful and zealously guarded their power. They were more interested in interfering in the affairs of Italy than in making Germany a strong united nation state.
By the middle of the 17th century, the concept of “nation-state” was very much accepted in Europe, and it was legally recognised by the Treaty of West-phalia in 1648, though there were still some countries, such as Germany and Italy, which were only nations but not nation-states yet.
What was the Outcome? The balance sheet of the emergence of nationstates had quite a few entries on both sides. On the credit side, we can mention following points: The new nation-states not only succeeded in putting an end to the extreme disorder and anarchy of the feudal times, but also destroyed serfdom in countries where it had not already disappeared. They boosted the economic development by improving the ways of working to produce and exchange things that people needed. The replacement of militaristic and arbitrary limits of ancient empires and medieval estates by more rational boundaries was a thing achieved by their emergence. They also brought together people who shared common cultural traits, and thus enabled many groups of people to develop their talents. Moreover, in the wake of their emergence, people found several ways of self-expression and have made special contributions that the people of the whole world can share.
Unfortunately, the debit side is not clean. A strong feeling of nationalism, for instance, grew up in each state with several ill effects. This led to national jealousies, rivalries and conflicts over matters like trade in the beginning, and later on over the issue of acquisition of colonies in Asia, Africa and the America. Thus, the greed of these nation-states for colonies, maximum profits and national glory led to many wars among them. Besides, their rulers, eager to put Machiavellian theories into practice, had consideration for no interest other than their own, and respected no other authority on matters of national interest.
Thirty Years War: Consolidation of State System
General Survey
The 30 years war, which began in central Europe in 1618 as a religious struggle between Protestant and Catholic rulers, became a fight for political power between the Bourbon rulers of France and the Hapsburgs of Austria and Spain. The war eventually involved all major European nations except England. It was fought almost entirely in Germany. The failure of the Treaty of Augsburg (1555) to settle all of Germany’s religious problems was the cause of the war. This treaty, ending the fight during the Reformation, had allowed each ruler of Germany’s 300 odd independent states to choose either Catholicism or Lutheranism as it official religion. But the treaty did not allone Calvinism. It also did not prevent the seizure of Catholic Church lands by Protestant German rulers. There was continuous rivalry among the princes, some of whom wanted independence.
Early fighting in Bohemia soon developed into a series of wars. When troops of the Holy Roman Empire put down the Bohemian revolt in 1620, the Protestant rulers in Germany, Denmark, and Sweden were angered. Denmark entered the war in 1625, and invaded Northern Germany, but Catholic armies led by Albrecht Wildenstein of Bohemia drove them out. Sweden went to the aid of the Protestants in 1630. King Gustavns led the Swedish army to several victories but he was killed in battle in 1632. Hapsburg rulers supported the Catholics in all these struggles.
France entered the war in 1635 when King Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu saw a chance to strike a blow against the Hapsburg rulers of Austria and Spain. Although France was largely a Catholic country, it supported the Protestant Sweden to keep the Catholic Hapsburgs from encircling France. France generals led their forces to victory over the Catholic allies of Austria, Germany and Spain.
The treaty of Westphalia signed in 1648, ended the 30 years’ war. It made changes in Europe’s map and France’s leading power. Hapsburg power in Germany and Spain declined. The treaty gave France most of Alsace and recognised France’s legal ownership of Metz, Verdun and Toul. Sweden received German along the Baltic and North Seas. The German state of Brandenburg received lands in Northern Germany. The independence of the Dutch Netherlands and Switzerland was recognised. In Germany, Calvinism was granted the same privileges as Lutheranism. All former Catholic Church lands were declared to be the property of those who had held them on January 1, 1624. Unfortunately the 30 Years’ War had tragic results in the thousands of deaths and great destruction it caused throughout Germany.
What was the Thirty Years War? Though the war (1618–48) started as a local conflict in Bohemia (a German principality), it soon spread to the whole of Germany and developed into a mighty struggle between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Later, the war even lost its original character of a religious struggle and became a political contest between the House of the Hapsburgs and the House of the Bourbons. At the centre of this war was a Hapsburg attempt to assert the imperial authority in Germany. Once again, cross-currents made nonsense of simple ideological conflict. As Hapsburgs and Valois (the ruling dynasty in France before the Bourbons) had disputed Italy in the 16th century, Hapsburgs and Bourbons had disputed Germany in the next, i.e., 17th century. Dynastic interest brought Catholic France into the field against the Catholic Hapsburgs under the leadership of Richelieu. France which was known as the ‘eldest daughter of the Church’, allied paradoxically with the Calvinist Dutch and Swedish Lutherans to assure the rights of the German princes.
The Peace of Westphalia which closed the 30 Years War was in several ways a turning point in European history. It brought the era of religious wars in Europe to a close. It also ended Spanish military supremacy on land and the dream of rebuilding the empire of a Charles V. It closed, too, an era of Hapsburg history. Hence forth the dynasty’s future was an Austrian one, however, much of its rulers sought to revive their power in Germany. There, a new power had appeared in the Electorate of Brandenburg, with which later Hapsburg power in Germany had been the work of outsiders, viz., France and Sweden. Here was the real sign of the future in Westphalia. A period of French ascendancy was beginning in Europe.
What were the Reasons for the War? Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II of Austria, wanted to consolidate his own position and secured a united Germany under his personal control. He saw a golden opportunity to achieve his aim in the prevailing religious confusion in Germany. But the German princes, who had become stronger during the Reformation, had their own plans. They desired complete independence from the controlling authority of the Emperor. Since the German Protestant states were the principal enemies of the imperial authority, the Emperor sought to destabilise them with the help of the Catholic League (formed by the Catholics to protect their own interests). The growth of the Emperor’s power was, however, a threat to the cherished independence of the local princes, and this possibility sent warning signals even to the Roman Catholic states. The apprehensions of the local princes introduced a political element into the struggle and gave the Protestants there a chance of survival.
Ostensibly, the primary factor of the war was extreme hostility between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The irreconcilable character of the two rival sects would not allow any satisfactory settlement and so there was extreme bitterness of feeling between the two.

30 Years War in Germany
The Peace of Augsburg (1555) that concluded after the first religious war in Germany, viz. the Schmalkaldic War, had several defects which caused constant discord between the Catholics and the Protestants. For one, it left the settlement of religion in the hands of the German princes without any consideration for the religious convictions of their people. Then, one of its articles, called the ‘Ecclesiastical Reservation’, provided that a bishop joining the Protestant religion would have to give up his office with all its possessions. This unjust and partial provision proved to be a constant source of conflict between the rival creeds. Finally, the peace totally neglected the Calvinists, another vibrant sect of Protestantism. Calvinism was, therefore, in a secure position due to this denial of the legal recognition for its existence.
Meanwhile, the Counter-Reformation made rapid progress. The Jesuits, its torch-bearers, not only halted the tide of the Protestant progress but also regained greater portion of Germany to the Roman Catholic Church. The Jesuit efforts were supported by Emperor Rudolf III, who gave up his predecessor’s policy of toleration. The Catholic reaction was also helped by the mutual jealousy between the Lutherans and the Calvinists. The Catholics naturally took up an aggressive attitude and began to thwart the Protestants in every possible way. So, the Protestants, especially the Calvinists, were goaded to form a defensive league, known as the ‘Union’. And the Catholics, in turn, came up with their own ‘Catholic League’. Thus, when both sides were at their wits end, Bohemian happening provided the necessary spark.
The people of Bohemia were predominantly Protestants. They were not, therefore, well disposed to Emperor Ferdinand II for his anti-Protestant policy. But the dissatisfaction of the people surfaced only when, at this instance, a Protestant Church was destroyed at Prague. Its people rebelled, threw the royal officers out of the castle, and offered the crown to Frederick, the Elector of Palatine. Frederick’s acceptance of the crown was a direct challenge to Ferdinand and the 30 Years War had begun.
How and when did it Take Place? The war can be divided into four stages or phases, each one signifying the shifting scenes of war and the participation of other powers in the struggle.
1.The Bohemian Phase (1618–23)
2.The Danish Phase (1624–29)
3.The Swedish Phase (1630–34)
4.The French Phase (1635–48)
Emperor Ferdinand II got the help of Catholic League (headed by Maxmilan of Bavaria) for a clash with the Protestants. Their combined forces not only defeated Protestants but also succeeded in driving Frederick of Palatine (head of Protestant Union) into exile. The Catholics were, thus, successful during the first phase as evident in the suppression of Protestantism in Bohemia. The travails of Frederick (who was a Calvinist), however, alarmed the hitherto indifferent Lutherans. Further, the Protestant rulers of Europe began to keenly watch the happening in Germany and started sympathising with the Protestant cause.
Denmark was the first among the several foreign powers to interfere in the German affairs and participate in the war. The Danish King, Christian IV, was very keen on taking up the cudgels against the Emperor (Ferdinand II) on behalf of the Protestants of Germany. He received huge amounts from the Protestant king of England, Charles I. But he was disgraced by the forces of the Catholic League on two occasions, and was compelled to abstain from further interference in German affairs. After Denmark’s exit from the war, the Emperor issued the ‘Edict of Restitution’ (1629) by which the Protestants were asked to return to the Catholic Church all ecclesiastical property which they had taken over since the Peace of Augsburg. This edict marks the peak of the Roman Catholic success. But since this extreme step affected majority of the Protestants, even the slothful Lutherans were stirred to activity, and they temporarily sank their differences and made common cause with the Calvinists against the Catholics. Thus the edict dashed any hope of a permanent settlement.
Sweden, the next foreign power to take part in the war, had both religious and political motives in doing so. The Swedes were staunch Lutherans, and their king, Gustavus Adolphus, regarded it to be his duty to protect the Protestant cause in Germany. From the political angle, the Swedish king hoped to control the entire Baltic coast and thereby make the Baltic Sea a Swedish lake. Moreover, he viewed the extension of the Emperor’s influence along the Northern coast of Germany as a threat not only to his above ambition but also to the safety of his state. France, though a Catholic state, entered into an agreement with the Swedish king against the Emperor for political reasons, i.e., to weaken the power of the Hapsburgs. Besides, all the Protestant princes of Germany finally decided to support the Swedish Origins of Modern Politics king. The forces of Sweden and Protestant princes of Germany together scored a convincing victory over those of the Catholic League at Breitenfield (1631) resulting in their triumph in North Germany. This victory not only nullified the impact of the Counter-Reformation but also saved Protestantism in North Germany. The Swedes once again triumphed over the Catholics at Lutzen (1632), but this time at the cost of their king’s life. Gustavus’s death was a severe blow to the cause of Protestantism in Germany, and almost negated their victory at Lutzen. For, he was the rallying point for the forces of Protestantism in Germany. Soon, the Catholic forces turned the tables on the Swedes at Nordelingen (1634), and gained control of South Germany. This was a turning point in the course of the war, because it paved the way for the entry of France, which was hitherto rendering only financial assistance to the Swedes against the Emperor. France’s assistance ended the religious nature of the war, for it now became a purely political conflict between the Hapsburgs and the Bourbons.
In 1635, France declared war on the Hapsburgs of both Austria and Spain. Initially, the Austrians and the Spanish seemed to have an upper hand, soon the French-Swedish duo turned the tide in their favour. The Swedes scored a number of victories, including the one at Wittstock. While the Swedes steadily moved southwards, the French patiently pushed across the Rhine. The French, led by Richelieu first and later by Mazarin, won a number of important battles against both the Spanish and the Austrians. The new Austrian Emperor, Ferdinand III (who succeeded Ferdinand II) was gradually reduced to a position of helplessness, and finally signed the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.
What was its Outcome? The political outcome of the war was much more significant than both the religious and the socio-economic outcome. First of all, the war led to the total disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire. By undermining the imperial authority while recognising the almost sovereign status of the princes, the Treaty of Westphalia strengthened the separatist tendency of the component states, and thereby destroyed whatever lingering notion of unity the Empire had. Not surprisingly, this treaty recognised Switzerland and Holland (Netherlands) as sovereign nation-states. The Empire ceased to exist as a reality and henceforth the Emperor was not more than an Austrian monarch.
More importantly, Germany underwent political rearrangement. By the terms of the treaty, Germany was cut up into more than 300 independent principalities whose princes maintained their own courts, armies and laws. Consequently, Germany became a loose confederation of states devoid of any notion of national identity or political unity. Besides, there were some important territorial changes affected in Germany. While Bavaria kept one portion of the Palatine, another portion of it was given back to the son of Frederick I. Brandenburg also acquired some new territories, including a part of Pomeranian, and it soon emerged as the mighty kingdom of Prussia which eventually banished Austria from Germany and achieved her political unification.
The war also resulted in the territorial expansion of France and Sweden and their ascendancy. By the terms of the treaty, France received three Bishoprics (Matz, Toul and Verdun) and most of Alsace (except the city of Strassburg and certain districts) from the Holy Roman Empire. The Alsatian land, in particular, gave France a foothold on the Rhine and open door to Germany. Sweden, on its part, secured the German lands along the Baltic and North Seas. These territorial gains made her one of the leading European powers of the time and secured her the mastery of the Baltic. Thus, the war resulted in the breakdown of the predominance of the Hapsburgs in Europe and the beginning of French ascendancy under the Bourbons.
In the religious field, the war restored the pre-war status-quo. The Southern and Western Germany remained Catholic, while the Northern part continued to be Protestant as before. Concerning the quarrels between the rival forces over Church property, it was settled that 1624 would be the cut-off year, and whatever land and other property that each side possessed in that year would remain so in future. Above all, Calvinism was finally given legal recognition in Germany.
Germany, in particular, had to bear the brunt of the war. Her population was drastically reduced, about two-third of it perished by either the sword or famine or pestilence. Cities declined, farmsteads and villages vanished and much of the country fell back into wilderness. Thus, the industry and agriculture of Germany were ruined considerably and a long period of moral and intellectual stagnation followed.
What was its Significance? The 30 Years War was a turning point in European history; it marked the end of an era of religious wars and the beginning of the era of political wars and aggrandisement. National rivalries which were hitherto caused and characterised by religious antagonisms would now take the shape of dynastic wars and struggle for colonial empire. This point is evident from the course of this war itself, which began as a religious war but ended as a dynastic struggle.
Besides, the territorial readjustments that were affected after the war laid the foundations of the future political history of Europe. The resultant changes in the relative position of powers contained the germs out of which developed the future complications of European history. The territorial gains of France, for instance, at the cost of Germany, though paved the way for the ascendancy of France, also caused the future rivalry between France and Germany for the control of Rhineland for the next 300 years. The rising power of Brandenburg, too, due to territorial enlargement, paved its way for the rise of modern Prussia. The Hapsburgs of Austria, after incurring heavy losses in Germany, began to seek compensation on the Danube for their losses on the Rhine, which resulted in future rivalry between Austria and Russia for the control of the Danube and for the share of the territory of the Turks in the East. Thus, a number of international problems which decided the future course of European history can be traced to the war.
Finally, the war and the treaty gave legal recognition to the concept of sovereignty and also a boost to the growth of international law. Though some sovereign nation-states had already come into existence in Europe by this time (e.g., France, England, Spain, etc.) it was after this war that the concept of sovereign nation-state was given legal sanction. The pretensions of the Holy Roman Emperor to the temporal leadership of Europe and Pope to universal spiritual supremacy were denied by the events of the war. As a result, equality of status and complete independence became the basis of the nation-state system in Europe. The Pope had now been deprived of his position as an international mediator, and the treaty showed that the public law of Europe was to be framed by diplomats and congresses of ambassadors. Further, the necessity of having an international code for regulating the mode of warfare was now felt more acutely that at any other time. A number of books on international law began to be published, the most important of them being book, Law of War and Peace by Grotius, known as the ‘Father of International Law’.
