These reforms will build on a series of transformative reforms rolled out by the Government in last several years. These reforms in gas sector will further deepen and spur the economic activities in the following areas: • The whole eco-system of policies relating to production, infrastructure and marketing of natural gas has been made more transparent with a focus on ease of doing business. • These reforms will prove very signifi cant for Aatmanirbhar Bharat by encouraging investments in the domestic production of natural gas and reducing import dependence. • These reforms will prove to be another milestone in moving towards a gas-based economy by encouraging investments. • The increased gas production consumption will help in improvement of environment. • These reforms will also help in creating employment opportunities in the gas consuming sectors including MSMEs. • The domestic production will further help in increasing investment in the downstream industries such as City Gas Distribution and related industries. 

The Road Ahead

When the road is rough, a fi rm control over brake and accelerator determines how smooth the ride would be. The same holds true for the unprecedented situation we are in. It began with a complete lockdown, to contain the pandemic and ensure better preparedness, and now with the series of unlocks, the economic activities are gradually gaining momentum. The tradeoff is between accelerating economy and applying brake to control the pandemic. Monetary and fi scal measures taken in this direction are important for this road to recovery. Though, infl ation, employment scenario and the ongoing health crisis will continue to cast a shadow for a while. International cues especially the progress on the vaccine front will decide by when the international travel can resume, businesses can revitalise, offi ces can resume with full workforce, and economy embraces the new normal way of functioning. The reforms and stimulus under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative aim to strengthen and reboot various sectors. Based on the pillars of Economy, Infrastructure, System, Demography and Demand, the reforms resolve to provide impetus to sectors and areas which have noticed sluggish movement. The Aatmanirbhar Bharat Package includes wide-ranging interventions such as direct benefi t transfer, food security, rural jobs under MGNREGS, Credit Guarantee schemes for MSMEs and Kisan Credit Card Scheme. To infuse money into the economy and boost consumption, the Government has taken various measures including the LTC Cash Voucher scheme and Festival advance to the central government employees. The extent of support in comparison with the rest of the world suggests India’s intervention is wide-ranging, pragmatic and catering to the localised needs. The Principal Economic Adviser in the lead article of this Special issue has elucidated on the “Barbell” strategy used in fi nancial markets – i.e. hedge fi rst for the worst possible outcome while progressing step-by-step with updating of information and has compared it with the strategy devised in India to combat the impact of pandemic and the rationale behind it. The issue discusses in detail various monetary measures to consolidate the state of economy. It also brings out the possibility of changing landscape of industries and businesses with certain businesses losing relevance while bringing new opportunities to some service and tech-based sectors. Efforts to develop a multi-dimensional and multi-scalar response that acknowledges the contribution of migrants in the economy of cities have been highlighted. India is uniquely placed in terms of demographic dividends. Over 62% people in the country fall in the age group of 15-59 years which is expected to rise up to 65% by 2035. Job losses due to the pandemic are a grim reality. The current situation has certainly devastated a large section of the working population. But, there has been a growing trend towards efforts to increase employment opportunities. The recent announcement by the Government regarding creation of National Recruitment Agency is likely to be a game changer in terms of streamlining and standardising the processes. It is important to focus on advancement of skills in line with the emerging economic realities of the market. Given this, there is a need for the government and private sector to work together to address skill gaps and link supply with demand and vice-versa. Equipped with the right skills to meet the emerging demand of the new industrial era, the youth will be the torchbearers of India’s march to becoming a self-reliant nation. Agriculture has already demonstrated its potential to revive the pandemic-hit economy. To sustain agricultural growth and boost rural economy in post-Covid era, it is critical to have a robust infrastructure in place to support farm and farm-processing based activities. Midst the slump, agriculture has shown a bright spot. Being an agrarian economy, agriculture is the core sector which generates employment. Spurring the rural economic growth can give new direction to the economy. This edition of Yojana seeks views and opinions of experts to assess the current economic situation, its impact on various sectors and the road that lies ahead.

Preparing India for an Uncertain Post-Covid World Sanjeev Sanyal The world has just experienced the biggest shock since World War II. The immediate response is well underway. Based on a “barbell strategy”, India’s economic and health response has been somewhat different than that of other countries in terms of sequencing and emphasis of various measures. The long-term response, however, is aimed at making the Indian economy more resilient and flexible in order to deal with the opportunities and problems of the post-Covid world. he world economy experienced a major crisis there had been a major outbreak in Wuhan, China, and that in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

After all, it would have been difficult to predict in 1940 that British and French colonial empires would collapse within a decade, that global geo-politics would be dominated for half a century by a US–USSR Cold War, that man would set foot on the moon, and that televisions would become everyday items. So, how can one prepare for an uncertain new world? Rather than invest in a rigidly master-planned response, it is better to invest in two things: flexibility and resilience. This is the context in which recent supply-side reforms need to be seen. Even a cursory look at recently announced structural reforms would show that they have one thing in common- an attempt to encourage flexibility and adaptation in India’s economy. The agriculture sector reforms free-up farmers to sell their produce as they wish while those involved in the supply chain can invest in storage without and even deficit monetisation. Indian media and academics fear of being labeled “hoarders”. This will allow the farm tend to be excessively critical of monetisation. This is sector and farm-related industries to adapt their activities dogma. Carefully calibrated monetisation should be part to changes in demographics, climate change, consumer of the financing mix. tastes and so on.
